# DARIA Interview Tool - RC1 Fixes

## Summary of Key Improvements for RC1 AWS Deployment

### Fixed Character Dropdown in Interview Setup
- Properly populates the character dropdown in interview_setup page
- Added support for properly loading analysis prompts from character templates
- Fixed PromptConfig model to include the analysis_prompt field

### Fixed YAML Template Issues
- Fixed YAML parsing errors in character templates (askia.yml, synthia.yml)
- Added proper escaping for special characters in YAML files
- Added debug scripts to validate YAML file structure

### Fixed Speech-to-Text Integration
- Added 'success' field to audio service responses
- Fixed transcription addition to interview transcripts
- Added error handling for audio service integration
- Fixed ElevenLabs voice selection on interview_setup page

### Service Management Improvements
- Created restart scripts for proper service control
- Fixed port conflicts between services
- Added proper initialization of the PromptManager class
- Added debugging tools for audio services
- Created new service management scripts:
  - `start_services.sh`: Launches both audio service and main application
  - `stop_services.sh`: Gracefully stops all running services
  - `debug_audio.py`: Diagnoses audio service issues

### How to Use the New Service Scripts

#### Starting All Services
```bash
./start_services.sh
```
This will:
- Start the audio service on port 5007
- Start the main application on port 5010
- Save process IDs for easy shutdown

#### Stopping All Services
```bash
./stop_services.sh
```
This will:
- Stop any running DARIA services
- Verify ports are released
- Work even if the PID file is missing

#### Debugging Audio
```bash
python debug_audio.py
```
This will:
- Check if audio services are running
- Test ElevenLabs voice generation
- Verify voice configuration

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved error logging throughout the application
- Added debug endpoints for diagnosing issues
- Added detailed error messages for common failure scenarios

### Prepared for AWS Deployment
- All modifications tested locally and ready for RC1 AWS deployment
- Remote interview features will be fully available after AWS deployment
- Fixed template references to ensure proper rendering in AWS environment

## Known Issues and Limitations
- Make sure your ElevenLabs API key is set in the environment
- Some character templates may still need analysis_prompt fields added
- The service scripts assume a Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS)

## Next Steps
1. Upload codebase to AWS environment
2. Configure AWS-specific settings
3. Enable remote interview functionality
4. Complete final testing on AWS environment
