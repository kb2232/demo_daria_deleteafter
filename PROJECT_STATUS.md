# Daria Interview Tool - Project Status Update

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Critical Indentation Error
- Fixed the indentation error in `run_interview_api.py` at line 2879
- Properly structured the transcript processing code to ensure correct Python syntax
- Successfully tested transcript uploads with the corrected code

### 2. Startup & Configuration
- Created convenient start/stop scripts (`start_server.sh` and `stop_server.sh`)
- Added proper handling of existing processes to avoid port conflicts
- Implemented environment variable checks for OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys

### 3. Feature Verification
- Successfully tested LangChain integration
- Verified transcript upload functionality with Zoom format
- Confirmed analysis generation works correctly
- Checked TTS and STT services are operational

## Current Status

The application is now stable and operational with the following capabilities:
- Transcript uploads and processing
- LangChain-powered interviews
- AI-based analysis of interviews
- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality
- Discussion guide management

## Remaining Issues

Several non-critical issues remain to be addressed:
1. LangChain deprecation warnings need to be fixed
2. Monitor interview functionality has some errors
3. Refactoring opportunities exist throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks:**
   - Update LangChain imports to use langchain-community
   - Fix the monitor interview functionality

2. **Medium-Term Improvements:**
   - Enhance transcript processing with more robust speaker detection
   - Improve error handling throughout the codebase
   - Add more comprehensive logging

3. **Long-Term Enhancements:**
   - Refactor transcript processing into its own module
   - Add support for additional transcript formats
   - Implement more sophisticated UI/UX features
