[King, Warren] 13:16:15
Hi, Steven. It's Warren.

[King, Warren] 13:16:21
Can you hear me? Hey, doing well. Happy New Year as well.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:16:23
Sorry, I'm on mute. How are you doing?

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:16:28
Many years.

[King, Warren] 13:16:29
Sorry for the last minute slash moving it around, but you know, it's that.

[King, Warren] 13:16:34
It's that time.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:16:36
Yeah, I had a doctor's appointment so i had to reschedule, but I got it out of there. They went longer than usual.

[King, Warren] 13:16:42
Okay, no worries. No worries. But cool. Well. I don't want to take too much of your time. I know we have 15 minutes, but great to meet you. I'm Ilya's coach. I've been working with him over the past year.

[King, Warren] 13:16:53
He did indicate that you're someone that he worked with over the past year. He didn't indicate exactly like what project or what initiative. So we'd love to get your perspective on like.

[King, Warren] 13:17:04
That, what the project was, what his role was, and sort of like how you interacted with him.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:17:09
Okay, so Ely and I go back a long ways. We're on Kaiser Permaneti. I was the lead UX person there in, I would say.

[King, Warren] 13:17:10
And…

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:17:16
Ilya is probably the best UX person there. His skills in ux in front of a client in his presentation and his general presence is outstanding.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:17:25
And then his ability on the tools, he's a mastro on Figma.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:17:30
And now he's teaching me new things. So I always go back when I needed to go at the beginning of the year was in January. I was trying to redo all my user experience decks from 11, you know, from the 14 years I've been at Deloitte

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:17:44
So I consult with Ilya for feedback on UX methodology on a UX agile playbook that I keep current.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:17:53
And, you know, just get feedback on my So this year, I missed out on AI when I was at Kaiser for three years, so I wanted to catch up.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:18:04
So I used a lot of AI to use a lot of redo all my decks, update them.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:18:10
You know stylistically starting with with whatever but then I went on and did a little more just ai type development where I developed a chat using a co-pilot thing. And Ely would always be there to kind of check my work. I'd practice presentations with him.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:18:25
And provide feedback so that I can improve my presentations. And take them to the partners and executive leadership after. So I always kind of run things by him.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:18:34
And then happenstance alias, it's happened more than once now when he's um I've taken over for him on projects. This year he got sick with COVID.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:18:43
And it took over on UBS. So it's always hard shoes to fill because he leaves such an impression with both the client and the team members and His artifacts are outstanding. So it's daunting to to take over for him, but I'm getting better at it. I've had the opportunity to do it.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:18:59
Three times now. So it's just random that it happens that way.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:19:04
So, um. You know, it was just a good sounding board in the us peer and person I rely on a lot to check on my work.

[King, Warren] 13:19:13
Perfect. So you'd say like your interaction with him is kind of more generally, right? There wasn't like a specific…

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:19:20
On UBS, we had a specific project where he got sick and I took over for the financial work on the wireframes presenting to the You know, we did evaluative research with a client. He set up a lot of the jam files for those sessions. And then he was able to

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:19:35
Even though he was sick, he made himself available to me offline privately.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:19:40
When we needed to catch up and sync and get a project history. So he's very thorough on handing things off. That was the actual UBS project, which he did have. And then… In general, even outside of that, whenever I've been trying to figure out new strategies and techniques for using

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:19:56
Different forms of AI to supplement the UX research methodologies.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:20:02
So when I get a new method and a new approach, I present it to him.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:20:07
First and get his feedback for refinement.

[King, Warren] 13:20:11
Perfect.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:20:13
He's a good friend, a strong colleague, and a valuable resource.

[King, Warren] 13:20:17
Perfect, perfect. Any feedback areas that for him that you may have noted?

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:20:23
Hey, I think very highly of Elia. So I don't really have, I'd have to really struggle to give him feedback in the past when i when i was he was working on the project team, I provided more feedback But this year he's been a valuable resource.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:20:37
So he's given me feedback to expand my internal He goes, I've been here 14 years, but I can still work harder to build out an internal network and advocate for some of these hidden resources that I use.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:20:50
When I have projects, but share them with others and make it more known so that other might be able to benefit from.

[King, Warren] 13:20:56
Yeah. Are there any like initiatives that you guys worked on together at all or mainly more like the client?

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:21:02
Well, all of my initiatives, I had a sponsor with Tim Jervich to to work on using co-pilot to develop different AI tools. And we did chats for a fictitious However, Oregon Health Exchange website, we did a chat with your plan. So we loaded about 30 plans in there and had conversations. We did a

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:21:23
Sentiment analysis where it would take the user's question and determine the sentiment and provide a recommendation of how to answer their question. And those are different types of chats.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:21:32
So those were initiatives that I presented them. I did a big road show. Anyone that would listen.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:21:37
And the big feedback is like people would say, why am I looking at a health exchange website?

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:21:43
And really, I was trying to do an AI demonstration. But I just had this really robust health exchange website as a shell, but it took away from the presentation. He pointed that out and helped me kind of find some ways to overcome that.

[King, Warren] 13:21:55
Okay. So it just helps you pretty much like refine those presentation Against those initiatives. Okay.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:21:59
Yep, yep. And then brainstorming and coming up with, you know, helping me kind of figure out when would my um When my backlog was empty, I go to Ilya to help built with new ideas on things we could do differently or

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:22:14
Features we could add.

[King, Warren] 13:22:16
Perfect. Cool. And… Yeah, I think that's pretty helpful.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:22:20
That's helpful.

[King, Warren] 13:22:23
Like I said, I didn't get much background, so I was trying to understand. I think you have…

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:22:27
Just exactly what ours yeah we've probably been together three years now at least.

[King, Warren] 13:22:33
Perfect. Okay.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:22:36
So are you in the Chicago office? Oh, New York. So how is New York one? That's one of my favorite studios.

[King, Warren] 13:22:36
No, I'm based out of New York.

[King, Warren] 13:22:42
Yeah, this same old same in New York. Folks are just getting back into the swing of things.

[King, Warren] 13:22:49
I will be in the studio later this week, so probably tomorrow and Thursday, but yeah, no.

[King, Warren] 13:22:54
Same old, same. In New York.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:22:55
Yeah, my current project is JPMC, so I get to go to New York about once a month to work with them, which is always fun. But most of the work that they're doing is out of the New Jersey City, Jersey City offices.

[King, Warren] 13:23:00
Nice.

[King, Warren] 13:23:08
Pretty city, yeah.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:23:08
And we go across the ferry to get to the JPMC downtown.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:23:12
33rd Street facility. See that.

[King, Warren] 13:23:15
Well, yeah, next time you're in town, definitely… Shoot me a ping if you can slide over to the studio. I'm typically there Thursdays at the minimum and then Sometimes they try to come in on Tuesdays as well when the does that.

[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:23:26
Yeah, Thursday seems to be the office. Also for… For all of the JPMC, that was the day I visited and everybody happened to be there because most people are still at home on Zoom.

[King, Warren] 13:23:34
Right. Perfect. Cool. Well, Steven, I don't want to take too much
