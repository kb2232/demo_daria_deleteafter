  "transcript": "Interviewer: Daria (UX Researcher)\nDaria: Hi there! I'm Daria, and I\u2019m really excited to chat with you today. To start off, could you tell me a little about your role and the work you do? I\u2019d love to understand your experience with the product or service we\u2019ll be discussing.\nParticipant: Emma user researcher I knew research for Deloitte I speak with real people ask their needs understand and then we look for Open Spaces great younique wonderful products for their needs for our clients\nDaria: That sounds like a fascinating role, Emma! Understanding real people's needs is so crucial in creating effective solutions. Can you share an example of a particularly interesting or surprising insight you've gained from your user research? How did that insight influence the product or service you were developing?\nParticipant: my name is Steven Dulaney  I am a user researcher I've been a researcher for 27 years understanding real people's needs is crucial so I like to get them to tell stories about a certain time that they had a good or bad event the act of them recalling a story puts them in a different mindset I also like to ask kind of big open questions once I get them talking about their background and how they get started I simply asked what is your primary goal and you can see the expression on their face and they have to go into a different mode of thinking and that helps get them into a different mindset and you get unique and useful insights\nDaria: That\u2019s such an insightful approach, Steven! Encouraging people to share their stories can really tap into their emotions and motivations. It must lead to some valuable insights. Can you tell me about a specific story or insight that stood out to you during your research? How did it change your perspective on the product or service development?\nParticipant: oh good call now you're turning it on me well let me think about the time when we were designing for Lockheed Martin  Lockheed Martin builds the F-22 in the F-35 and we had to do is research to understand why they were having such a problem using sap to manage their parts  so they had been doing this for 30 years it turns out with with fighter jets there's about a two or three year software Trail for a single part for like a screw before it gets certified and can be used so tracking down the way they use the the materials totally totally different so we actually had to walk to people and ask them and try to figure out where does the new what happens next how does it get so we trace it all the way to the people that were using it to configure in order so that it would be available for a plane that was on the manufacturing line almost a mile long internal space and it probably had maybe 35 different stations with as you walked from one into the other you started to see an airplane first just crazy parts then maybe an engine\nDaria: That sounds like a complex and fascinating project, Steven! It\u2019s impressive how you navigated the intricacies of part management in such a high-stakes industry. Given the challenges you faced with SAP and the certification process, what were some specific user needs or pain points that you discovered? How did those insights translate into actionable recommendations for improving their system or processes?\nParticipant: well after we'd interview lots of people we built both personas for our Target users that were going to be using the apartment management system which was a custom screens for sap and then we build Journey mapping we posted the journey map as a shared object on the wall so that we could see the whole process and on the journey map after we had worked we brought some of the same people back in for the discovery and we were able to identify the different stages that mattered where it's off work and have an impact and we could also identify opportunities and and roadblocks and bridges and so that way we were able to convert that that through in the opportunities\nDaria: That's fantastic, Steven! It sounds like the journey mapping and persona development were pivotal in visualizing the user experience and identifying those crucial pain points. What were some of the key opportunities you discovered during this process? Additionally, how did you go about implementing the changes or recommendations you identified, and what impact did those changes have on the users and the overall system?\nParticipant: well after we took the opportunity analysis we took that and we turned them into actual kind of features or scenarios in the scenarios is where we actually built the wireframe screen so that someone could actually accomplish it for certain tasks that was identified we tested the wire frame prototypes with real users we made improvements and then we handed it off to the developer so they could build a screens in the sap Fury customer\nDaria: That sounds like a thorough process, Steven! Testing the wireframes with real users must have provided invaluable feedback before moving to development. What were some of the most significant changes or features that came directly from those user tests? Also, how did the users respond to the final product once it was implemented?\nParticipant: that was so long ago I don't have specifics at I guess that's the drawback of asking for a story is because I the story was relevant back then but I can't recall some of the details you're asking me about now\nDaria: That\u2019s totally understandable, Steven! The details of a project can sometimes blur over time, especially when you\u2019ve been involved in so many interesting ones. As we look ahead, I\u2019m curious about how the insights and processes you\u2019ve developed in your work have impacted your approach to new projects. Do you find that your experience with users in high-stakes industries like aerospace has influenced how you tackle research in other industries? If so, how?\n\nDaria: The interview has been completed. Thank you for your participation.\n",
