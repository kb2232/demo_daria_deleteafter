Researchers really like to go super deep um but You got to be able to think about what does that look like for a partner? What does that look like for a chief experience officer. What does that look like for a designer?\n\n [Stark, Theodore (Ted)] 08:35:07\nAnd how can you basically translate the super technical, the super deep into language and into a story will have the most impact and value for the audience of what you're trying to evangelize to.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 08:35:25\nOkay, what role does the look and feel of your outputs play in your evangelizing and educating?",
