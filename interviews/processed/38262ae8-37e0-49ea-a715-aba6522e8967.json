Let's send them to this site. Let's record their screen while they go. And we flipped around in one week's time. Really awesome insights about how bad that experience was and ways to improve it that led into more sold work.\n\n [Banwart, Jesse] 13:11:36\nThat ended up being something that is now there's like full screens for that new entry experience from affiliate sites so That was a great one. I love that.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:11:46\nOkay, that sounds interesting. So now we're going to go into process a little bit. I want you to think about the discovery process. Like you get a new, like that particular project how long when you get it, how long do you estimate like a project? How do you come up with an estimate in your mind? Is this six weeks? Is it nine weeks? Is it four weeks?\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:12:02\nHow does that art start?\n\n [Banwart, Jesse] 13:12:04\nYeah, I like in fig jam, they have like built out calendars and I like to time block in a calendar to help understand. So I'll say, you know.\n\n [Banwart, Jesse] 13:12:14\nWe'll need, in general, three, four days for synthesis. We'll want to launch on this day, close on this day. We'll need two weeks to plan the study. So I just kind of time block it out in a calendar on fig jam\n\n [Banwart, Jesse] 13:12:27\nAnd use that as the basis for what we do moving forward. Usually I account for some wiggle room you know, a day or two for each activity.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:12:34\nKnow what kind of information at the discovery phase, like in the first two or three days, are you trying to gather And what kind of form does it come in and what do you do with it?
