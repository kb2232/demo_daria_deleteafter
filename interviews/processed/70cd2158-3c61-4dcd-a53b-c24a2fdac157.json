Definitely.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:47\nAnd now that we have things like transcripts and dovetail and things like that.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:51\nYes, like I'm still uh so dovetail doesn't actually auto generate any insights or anything for you. They're trying, but they're not\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:50:58\nHave you tried like chat gbt to generate insights or summaries?\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:02\nYeah, I have.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:51:04\nThe first time, how did you feel the first time that you took a transcript and you generated summaries using an AI tool?\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:10\nI thought it was\u2026 crazy. I thought it was crazy. In a good way. I really do think that I thought that it was like a good thing.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:20\nI double checked my work. But honestly, and yes, I guess the more nuanced questions I asked it around, you know, what I There was two things.

Like I'm definitely not one of those people that says, all right, I'm uploading these 10\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:10\nI'm just going to put whatever I can and do the thing.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:13\nAnd I'm good. It would drive me crazy. I would actually not be able to sleep at night if I did not double check the work.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:21\nOkay, so now let's do one other thing. So when you originally generated those 10 summaries, how much pages in a Word document did you generate from those 10 interviews by hand?\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:32\nOoh, if I was only doing it by hand.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:35\nYeah, in the old days.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:38\nI think for those 10 interviews, I would at least be producing like just even given now an average, if I'm looking back across all of my projects.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:48\nI would still include like 15 to 18 slides\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:52\nOkay, so now how many, how much content do you generate?\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:58\nWith ChatGPT? Is it more the same or less?\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:02\nI would say it's the same ish. And the reason it is the same-ish is because I think like At this point in my research career like this it's almost not expected, but I know what good looks like in terms of like\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:17\nClient reception and things like that. So could I go crazy with chat GPT and give them like a book report? Sure. Do they want it? No.",

So it's typically ambition workshop research readout Opportunity, which includes like opportunity readout as well.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:38\nAnd then potentially wire frames if there's wireframes in there.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:52\nThen you have ideation workshops, then prioritization workshops, and then roadmap planning.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:58\nDo you have any materials you can share with me that I can kind of study that your methodology, to be quite honest, is a little dominant. I'm familiar with it.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:06\nI was self-taught, so I'm a little self-conscious about my methods. I started at Frog Design with Helmut Esslinger, who did the first plastic television.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:14\nAnd then he did the Max Snow White, the one piece macintosh design language and then Disney Cruise. So I learned to talk to real people the way German industrial designers do.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:25\nBut nothing existed in school. I was actually in the room with Business Week and Hartman when they created the term persona and scenario design.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:19:27\nWow.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:33\nWas supposed to be instead of journey map. But Persona kept stuck to this day.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:39\nAnd it was just a throwaway line in an interview with Business Week. And then\u2026 So it's interesting to see that. But sometimes I feel like an imposter because I have not had the training to even write a research plan and ask you, you start with a question. I mean, I do it instinctively, but I don't.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:57\nAnd when I come across people that have retraining, I'm always impressed and I always learn from you.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:03\nThat's fantastic. Oh my God. I'm starstruck. Wow. Yes. No, I mean, that's beautiful. Again, Stephen, to be honest with you, like.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:17\nAlways, always on the lookout.

This is what I love so far about ChatGPT.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:28:56\nIn a world where I'm overwhelmed, it's actually showing me new ways to think. And that's why I like it.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:03\nSo, you know, all of this, what you just did, right? Like whether asking about features or like even just like first go and things like that.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:11\nI genuinely feel like it's kind of doing some of that heavy lifting for me and I personally love it.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:17\nAnd now if I kind of like, again, spend the time to make it more nuanced and make it more you know detailed or special or whatever.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:25\nYou know, now I have more cognitive space to do that.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:30\nAnd I actually enjoy that a lot.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:29:32\nInteresting. See what I did here? I did wrong. That's crazy. I can't believe I did that.\n\n [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:38\nWhat happened?",
