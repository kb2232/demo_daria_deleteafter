Yeah.\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:33:10\nAnd\u2026 Yeah, I think it's important to start with the goals because like people will be like, okay, I have this design, I want to make sure it's going to work right so like that's often the situation that will come to me is like, let's test this design. It's like, okay, what do we want to test?\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:33:30\nWhat stage is this in? Are we testing perception? Are we testing usability? Are we testing like acceptance of new features like what actually um are we like, do we want needs pain points, you know what I mean?\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 09:33:45\nAnd so you're asking all those questions and what do they determine? You're asking this question for a reason.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 09:33:51\nSo when you get all those answers, what is that going to dictate?\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:33:55\nSo it dictates the legit, the type of study and like a lot of the logistics of the study so okay are we doing a usability test? Are we doing a design validation interview?",

Out of every transcript, basically I have to like\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:39:33\nTake out the name and any like identifying information of the participant\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:39:44\nYeah. So that's like during research week.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 09:39:49\nHe had an assistant for that week, what would the digital assistant be working on?\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:39:50\nMost of them.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 09:39:52\nTo help you save time.\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:39:56\nThe digital assistant.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 09:40:02\nEven if you had a person assistant, what would they be doing?\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:40:05\nWell, a personal assistant is always really helpful to be doing a lot of the note taking so that I can focus on like being in the moment with the participant and like asking the next question.\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:40:19\nAnd like only noting down like certain things that I find are like extra kind of insightful And so anytime i've had\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:40:32\nLike a assistant it's helpful to do that. And then also like doing the session summary with them to make sure like, okay, we had two eyes, like they said this, how did you interpret this? I interpret it this way okay we match great oh we don't match okay we're going to have to go back and like look at the recording and look at it again.\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:40:56\nSo yeah, like taking notes in the moment is really important and then I cannot stress enough.\n\n [Doutcheva, Nadia] 09:41:03\nEspecially when we're trying to be time efficient, the importance of a post-session summary",
