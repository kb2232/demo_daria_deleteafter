You bleeped out a little.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:29\nDid you do formal interviews with stakeholders or did you just kind of collect and listen as you're having your kickoff week?\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:54:37\nNo, we did live interviews and walked them through the card sorts and You know?\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:43\nNow, are those different from the user interviews or those? I mean, I'm considered stakeholders\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:54:49\nWell, there are all kinds of stakeholders because they're employees of the company.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:53\nOkay, interesting.\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:54:54\nSo it's kind of\u2026 a see a B2E, business to employee.\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:55:02\nRight. So, but we've had 20 different employees.\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:55:06\nAnd we went through card sorts with him via video And in like figma jam And walk them through the activity, ask them a bunch of questions, took notes, synthesized the data, and came up with our recommendations.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:21\nSo how soon did you realize that a card sort would be one of the activities you would require?\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:55:27\nPretty much right away because it was a feature based thing And a lot of what was out of the box, but then there was some room for customization and You know, picking and choosing the features that are most important\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:55:45\nIs easily done in a card sort and then a tree test of the prioritization of them.\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:55:52\nMore than like a user interview when you're asking questions of a different type of nature to come up with completely 100% customized features or solutions.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:56:05\nOkay. What kind of artifacts or what kind of reports did you generate based on the card sort?\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 13:56:05\nSo\u2026",

So it's just kind of like what you did.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:10\nThese are the journey maps. That you created. So it's like your research assistant homepage.\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 14:09:17\nAre all of these cards a different project?\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:20\nYes, they just have the same name because I'm doing I've resorted to reading green eggs and ham into the interview guide.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:27\nBecause I don't have things to say.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:32\nSo this is all your research. Yours will go here next.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:35\nAnd then I'll start to have real This is the research this is the Goals, streamline research possibilities to enhance to maintain relevance and compete. So this is the one from yesterday.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:50\nOne interview. So just in general, she had a research assistant\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 14:09:55\nI'm thinking. So.\n\n [Ballew, Suzette] 14:10:01\nI would like, you know, where are we defining in solving the problem statement and the hypothesis.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:10:09\nOkay, good, good. So specifically like maybe a actual project question page.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:10:17\nLike, what am I actually here for?",
