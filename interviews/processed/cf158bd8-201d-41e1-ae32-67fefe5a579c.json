I always do you know\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:12:01\nWhat do you call that step?\n\n [Ti] 13:12:10\nReassurance. I don't know what to say you know like reassurance like i think that's really important because sometimes you you get into a you get into a zone, you narrow yourself into a thought and then you're like, okay, these are the things\n\n [Ti] 13:12:24\nAnd you couldn't really jump out of your own kind of mental model and you need some other opinions to kind of help you to help you to do that even with design, I feel like, you know, we're getting so deep into one like\n\n [Ti] 13:12:40\nDirection and then we couldn't really get ourselves outside of that. And then we got zoned into it.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:12:45\nYeah.\n\n [Ti] 13:12:47\nSo that\u2026 that I would really love to get a second opinion on.\n\n [Ti] 13:12:54\nAnd then when we conduct the research, normally we would plan enough manpower to do it.",

You're kind of doing that and then\u2026 making recommendations i mean then you get a few different points of the problems you find from the testing or user research, right?\n\n [Ti] 13:22:08\nAnd then\u2026 kind of speak about your summarize the total things that should be changed or recommendations that you want to make if it's a new product And if it's a use-based testing or some sort of screen you give them.\n\n [Ti] 13:22:27\nThen you tell them, you show at the end like what should be changed based on a couple of big points that you got from the affinity mapping, right? That's sort of what I'll do.\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:22:37\nAre there any certain things that you like peek up and you hear that you kind of know it's in the back of your mind, you got this monitor when it hears it Is there anything special that you're listening for?\n\n [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:22:49\nDuring an interview that would change your behavior from just regular note-taking?",
