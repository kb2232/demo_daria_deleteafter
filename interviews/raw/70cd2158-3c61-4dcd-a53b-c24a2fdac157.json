I'm doing fine. Thank you so much for spending time with me today.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:31:40\nOf course, of course.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:31:42\nNow, the obligatory, do I have your permission to make a transcript and to do a recording?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:31:48\nYes, definitely. And just as an FYI, my internet is suffering today and I've been saving on bandwidth wherever I can.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:31:50\nOkay.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:31:58\nIf you cut out and can't hear me, just let me know.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:32:01\nOkay. Okay, it should be fine.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:01\nAnd\u2026 Come back on.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:32:06\nSo do you have any questions before we start? Okay. Well, thank you for the time with me. Can you tell me how long have you been a user researcher?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:09\nNo, this is great. Thank you for connecting.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:17\nFor sure. Absolutely. It's been a now seven years. Oh.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:32:23\nNow, who do you have like how did you learn? How did you become a user researcher? Do you have any influential people that got you started or\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:30\nI actually went to school for it. Yes. My MFA is in interaction design. Interaction design is a holistic degree. A part of that degree, like about six or seven months or so, we had rigorous training in user research.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:45\nI had many mentors and professors along the way that inspired me.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:49\nThey had their learnings from their mentors and everything that inspired them.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:53\nSo yeah, happy and lucky to have been part of a cohort that really inspired like essentially the just enough research to start right as a designer For America Hall. But yeah, that was my beginnings and it was Onwards from there.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:04\nYep.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:10\nAnd how long have you been at Deloitte?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:12\nFour years in February this year.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:15\nOkay, so what's your current responsibility and roles?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:19\nYeah, I am the design ops lead at Novant Health. I've been on this account now for a year and two months. I lead their design ops team it is a team of researchers, strategists, designers About me about 14 people on the team so far.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:39\nAcross all shores, so US, ADMX and USI.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:43\nOkay, that's fascinating. Now, with respect to your roles and responsibilities, what is your primary goal?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:49\nOh, yes, for sure. So my primary goal is to make sure that all of our projects are being delivered With excellence. And these projects are ranging, I want to say about 40. So I lead about eight or nine different projects for that\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:08\nClient and think like different work streams and I want to say about 45 to 55% of it has research in it. So it could be like grounds up discovery Or it could be evaluative.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:22\nOr it could be a mix. And then the rest is like.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:27\nMore design based ideation based and delivery based.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:34:32\nOkay, with respect to your primary goal, what are some key frustrations that you encounter?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:37\nThis delivery with excellence. I think\u2026 Right now, it's more about the skill gap that sometimes our junior resources, especially across the USI shores They are not very adept at research as well as analysis, synthesis, that side of the house.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:57\nSo it's a lot of like hand-holding when it comes to actually delivering the work. I think that's a pain point.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:05\nI'm finding that, sorry, excuse me, I'm finding that research in general as a People think they know it, but they really don't, you know, in the most like core of its meaning. What do I mean by that is like.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:22\nYou know um they think that they know how to use your test You know, that they've done enough kind of like, you know, tries and they're hitting on the right things, but it's really not the truth.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:33\nYou know, it's like it's pretend research, unfortunately.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:38\nThat doesn't really tell you everything. So I would say that, you know, that's one of my biggest pain points and I actually brought on a co-lead with me from Applied Design.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:49\nAnd, you know, thankfully she had more of a research background and has been helping me kind of, you know, mentor the team really you know all the way from like creating interview guides to how to run interviews to analysis, synthesis\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:36:02\nYou know and then actually rewarding out So I'm finding like, you know, a lot of people think they know research, but they don't\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:36:11\nOkay. Well, that sounds good. So let's go back to when you started eight to six years ago. How did you consider what kind of tools and how did you consider your understanding of planning a research project?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:36:21\nYeah. Oh my goodness. So it was like very greenfield to me, right? Like it was um So I come from like a marketing background and for me like research was like, oh, you know, think competitive research, think client research, think like market research and things like that. So it was very like um\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:36:37\nMarketing based. And when I got into UX or user experience You know, kind of was like, oh, everything is from a consumer perspective still but you know instead of like focusing on how to sell to them. It's like what works for them. And so the tools that started to become available to me were definitely, again, as part of my master's degree.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:00\nI went to, I was directed to books, right? I was directed to books in which like it was about, you know, learning different methodologies. So qual, quant.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:12\nEthnographic. Evaluative.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:16\nAnd so depending on the different projects. Our professors actually helped us navigate you know based on scope and timing and what was actually involved? What is the objective to determine the right type of a methodology or a methodology I guess like formula\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:36\nAnd, you know, back then, I would say\u2026 there were not a lot of like user testing tools. I'm not saying that they weren't there, but I would say that I saw a more of like a focus on how to use those or like\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:53\nHow to use the virtual tools and more of the kind of now what we know to be usertesting.com, dovetail.com, which I lead here.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:03\nThat really happened after COVID, I would say. Before COVID, we were more used to like, oh, let's go out into the field and let's do that type of research and things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:12\nYou know, planning was in person. So like all the way from, you know, oh, an outline to an interview guide to You know, how are we going to go and recruit people? It was very much like.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:22\nNon-virtual. And now I feel like even after quote unquote the pandemic.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:28\nI feel like it has remained virtual or at least has been my kind of experience so far but also like if I talk to my colleagues and peers in the research world and other deck or, you know.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:43\nFirms, it sounds like they are following similar standards still as well. So the boom of tools like usertesting.com etc has remained, I'd say.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:38:53\nOkay, so that's good. I'm also assuming that summarizes how you do research now in the last two years and how it's changed.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:02\nYes. Wow. So I definitely see it changing and being evolved by the use of AI because it's happening real time right now.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:39:03\nWhat do you see in the next three years changing?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:15\nEven in our own firm You know, like there was so much emphasis about, you know, how to conduct the perfect interview perfect i say you know the core of leave assumptions at the door, like, you know, come with this like mindset\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:30\nThere was so much great emphasis on like, you know, the art and the method of conducting research And I feel like now, which is good. I am for it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:41\nBecause again, I view AI as a tool rather than an enemy, to be honest with you. But now we have things like Outset that will perform the interview for you. And it kind of like, at first it set off alarm bells because I was like, oh my God.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:54\nYou know, how are people going to react to a robot asking them questions, for example?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:00\nBut the truth of the matter is that that's where that's where we're going. I do think like that's going to be shaped now the quality of the output is yet to be determined. I don't know about it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:15\nEnough yet. I haven't played around it myself you know enough yet.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:20\nBut I do think like, you know, now having contributed to research for these types of duels, whether it's like at the top of the funnel of the research, whether it's planning, conducting.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:29\nOr the output, right? The analysis of synthesis, I do think like it will be it will be faster through tools in certain processes, but it does need human evaluation and an eye I also am curious, I'll be honest, this is an open thing in my mind is that\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:48\nI don't know. I don't know what the world of research is going to perceive us as perceive quality research anymore.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:57\nSo what do I mean by that is that previously, or at least like again growing up school design methodology, even application like My interview at Dublin or delo back then was based on like, how do I take my insights and produce something good out of it right so\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:18\nNow I wonder, like, even if Outset, for example, can conduct 500 interviews for me at a given time.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:25\nYou know, what am I really looking to make out of that. You know, previously, if I would have done like I was on a project that we did 60 interviews and we had a team of like six You know, I remember that being really valuable to the client.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:40\nNow I wonder if like 500 is even needed. I don't know.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:44\nSo it's like all these like different questions that I do have in my mind, I'll be honest with you i But yeah, I kind of like\u2026 You know, I am being taken along this ride and I'm welcoming it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:58\nAnd contributing to it where I can.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:42:02\nThat sounds great. So can you think of a story where you had a research assignment or research project that you wanted to do. And no matter how hard you tried at every turn, it became complicated and frustrating and had a bad outcome.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:14\nOoh, that's a great question. Let me think. Really quickly here.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:25\nHmm. Um\u2026 Okay, so that 50 to 60 interview one, right?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:35\nI'll actually go back to that. Not trying to be hypocritical but I do think there were parts of it in which If there is an output that's already predetermined.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:46\nSo the implementation over there was that we were going to, for example.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:52\nImplement a Salesforce solution for the client anyway. We knew what the output was before an eight month project.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:00\nAnd our practice sold again heavy lift on research anyway.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:07\nSo we ended up kind of like, you know, doing this awesome, you know, it was a bank.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:11\nAnd we were supposed to interview about six or seven types of roles there. Think like everything from an analyst to a lead lead.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:19\nAnd, you know, director, senior director whatever And we ended up actually, while we enjoyed talking to and creating those personas and things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:31\nEven journeys to that point, it was such a nightmare trying to prove the value of it all to the client.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:38\nEspecially after we've solved for that. So, you know, it did not have a bad outcome. But what I will say is that like we had to sell our work after having sold our work and saying like while we're doing like this amazing stuff for you, look at this value\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:54\nThey were bringing and you know clients would actually get on the call and like for people who are like, why are you telling me about all of this stuff you know and like you would you would like kind of have to educate them before you told them about this awesome work you did\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:09\nIn the end, again, they saw the value, but we had to prove the value like every day. It was crazy.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:44:15\nThat sounds good. Now, can you think of a story where you had a project that They came out with a really happy ending that has a nice project and it surprised you with how people came together And had a good result.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:27\nYeah, yeah, yeah. So I'd say thankfully a lot of my projects are like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:32\nSo I'm grateful that again like and this is before though, like, I don't know what happens now When I say now, I really mean like an outside-led project, for example. But, you know, like if we are planning and kind of contribute like the messaging and the\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:50\nWe're there to control how it's going. I know how to pivot in an interview if I'm not liking how the conversation is going and like, you know, the, again, the emotion of the person, the comfort level of the person. I know all of that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:05\nSo, you know, I would say that thankfully, like a lot of my research projects have been knock on wood successful.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:11\nHowever, there was one project nationwide that I did in which like we had very limited kind of scope of interviews and things like that you know the client actually was very tough because they had researchers on their And, you know, we had to\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:29\nWe had to work with them and they were so particular. They were so particular. Like he would, this guy was a PhD in some sort of research methodology and he would come back with questions that would boggle our minds.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:41\nAnd so, you know, talk about like overeducated and having to prove our value but It was such a happy outcome because he actually liked the way that we did research, did interviews, things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:52\nIn the end was super happy with the outcome because we were able to kind of like you know bring that to the table and do it cleanly, he said.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:00\nSo, yeah.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:46:01\nOkay, that's a great story. So now I want to kind of step back and talk about how you plan a discovery because this is kind of like a There's two of them working on is going to try to support the discovery activities for a team.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:46:12\nAnd so can you kind of walk through the beginning? What are some of the things you consider? What are some of the inputs when you're planning maybe a nine-week discovery project?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:23\nAbsolutely. So when we're planning for like, let's say a nine-week discovery project, that sounds very much in length, actually.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:31\nIt's a lengthy discovery given like Again, I'm talking from a scope that I've seen from You know, Deloitte, for example, because, you know, it's like, I feel like more and more We have had to fight to lengthen discovery. And so, you know, nine weeks sounds luxurious. So I'll start.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:51\nThe type of inputs we'd be looking for, depending on, again, like regardless of actually whatever industry whatever You know, kind of um I guess like type of discovery let's say we are going green field inputs from stakeholders, key kind of like, you know, outcomes and KPIs, key impact. A lot of our businesses think that they already know everything.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:15\nSo, you know, kind of getting into their minds and, you know, seeing, all right, like if you're okaying a nine week discovery, what does that mean for you?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:23\nYou know, so it's like discovery with the stakeholder is so important. Then recruiting the right\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:47:27\nHow much of your time is spent managing those files and what do you do with those inputs once you get them from the client?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:35\nI think that we, so like the interviews or the discovery with the stakeholder is an active discussion Lately, in all of my projects, it's been dovetail.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:49\nA lot of my stuff goes into Dovetail because that's my go-to for analysis and synthesis.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:54\nAnd so it almost starts to become a repository for me.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:47:58\nOkay, get back to where you were. I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just wanted to get a little\u2026 Right.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:00\nOh, no, no, of course. So that's number one. Number two, download of the different types of users that we're going to be solving for.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:11\nAnd then start to actually recruit. So one of my tools becomes then of my tools any type of recruiting services we have, some that I've worked with in the past with Deloitte. We don't have descout anymore, but it used to be\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:24\nOne of my top favorite tools because it made recruiting so easy It made screening so easy. It made payments so easy.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:35\nThis guy was great. Lately, if I want to go a little bit more expert interviewee, like let's say if I am interviewing executives or more high net worth or again, depending on like the type of criteria, I've also used glg\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:52\nSo, you know, I'm doing like outreach to them I am planning\u2026 Definitely a timeline in which I'm communicating clear milestones and goals to the client. Like, hey, client.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:05\nAt the very least, I'm going to check in with you every week. We're going to have X amount of work done.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:11\nThese are the outcomes you can expect at every You know, turn, depending on how hands-on hands off the client is part of the discoveries, I would include like, you know, at least two like working sessions or think workshops with the client\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:26\nSome of it could be semi readout some of it could be like debriefs with the 5060.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:32\nInterview project. We used to have debriefs at 4 p.m. Every day.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:36\nBecause we'd be conducting four interviews Every day. So kind of like shaping as the story goes along It's so key I would say extended discovery projects.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:49\nWe would do competitive research. So as part of our desk research.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:54\nWe would definitely like think about the topic, think about competition think about what's already existing out there.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:01\nAnd all of that actually gets bundled in the same repository with my primary research as well.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:50:08\nAre you putting that into dovetail these days? Okay. And so before How much time did you spend analyzing transcripts versus now that you have Dovetail?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:11\nYes.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:19\nI would say that um With Dovetail, what changed was, well, there used to be a time where we didn't even have transcript generators until Otter came around and things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:32\nAnd the thing is, I'm not that, that old, but I do know that\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:50:36\nI know it's changed so fast. I do remember just taking hand notes and how much time you spent with those to get your analysis?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:40\nOh, yeah. Definitely. Oh my God. Definitely.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:47\nAnd now that we have things like transcripts and dovetail and things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:51\nYes, like I'm still uh so dovetail doesn't actually auto generate any insights or anything for you. They're trying, but they're not\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:50:58\nHave you tried like chat gbt to generate insights or summaries?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:02\nYeah, I have.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:51:04\nThe first time, how did you feel the first time that you took a transcript and you generated summaries using an AI tool?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:10\nI thought it was\u2026 crazy. I thought it was crazy. In a good way. I really do think that I thought that it was like a good thing.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:20\nI double checked my work. But honestly, and yes, I guess the more nuanced questions I asked it around, you know, what I There was two things. So the original or the kind of like more traditional researcher in me you know uh was like.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:40\nIf I am, actually, I'll go the opposite. Sorry, bear with me. So the new researcher or the person who wants to get insights and I know what are the different types of insights the client is looking for or will be valuable to my project or like\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:56\nI know that like our leadership even has interest in Obviously, I was asking you questions about that and was giving me what I wanted.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:04\nBut the traditional researcher in me likes to kind of like go through the transcript and look for those surprises or look for those tidbits that like are, you know, stood out in research and things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:16\nAnd that to me is what I missed the first time I did do a chat GPT generated You know, kind of insights back, if that makes sense so\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:52:27\nDo you think that you change your listening behavior in interviews now that you know you're going to have a summary and how has it changed?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:33\nOh, yeah.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:39\nOh, I feel like it's almost like, and I don't want it to sound negative but There's a certain muscle that you exercise when you're doing analysis and synthesis.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:51\nAnd which is critical thinking. And I feel like having a chat GPT or something like that Not that I'm not smart about it, but the thing is I might be more comfortable not looking in depth, if that makes sense.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:53:07\nAnd I feel like that muscle in me is less sharper the more I do rely on a chat GPT.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:53:16\nNow, how much time before ChatGPT, how much time did you spend sifting through a transcript to get a general summary that you could share with somebody?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:53:27\nI spend, and I can tell you, so for about 10 interviews, let's say If I had no meetings And if I could have heads down time, I would do it in five to seven business days.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:53:39\nNow, how much time, if you had those same 10 interviews with ChatGPT, How much time would you spend join the analysis that you could share with the client.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:53:49\nI would say two to three days. And even after Dovetail, I would say like that five to seven days was actually it brought it was brought down to three to four days because I'm almost like making connections as I'm doing the analysis through those interviews.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:07\nAnd so it's allowing me to like tag and, you know, already built like mini insights And then kind of ladder up to like a lot.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:14\nNow with those 10 interviews, how much time would it take for you to get the kind of the summaries that you got by hand?\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:22\nFour.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:24\nOh, um. How much time would it take me? Bye.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:28\nYeah, if you had the chat GPT at 10 interviews, think of the quality that you did in that one week period.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:36\nAnd try to compare it to how long that would take you to get to that level of detail.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:36\nUh-huh.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:41\nWith the chat tool.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:41\nGot it. Got it. I think\u2026 I think\u2026 I think it would take me, I would still want it like from actual creation to like delivery. It would take me four to five days still.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:55\nBecause I'm the kind of person and I don't mean this in a proud way, but I do know myself like it would make me anxious knowing I missed something if I didn't double check the work, if that makes sense. Like I'm definitely not one of those people that says, all right, I'm uploading these 10\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:10\nI'm just going to put whatever I can and do the thing.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:13\nAnd I'm good. It would drive me crazy. I would actually not be able to sleep at night if I did not double check the work.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:21\nOkay, so now let's do one other thing. So when you originally generated those 10 summaries, how much pages in a Word document did you generate from those 10 interviews by hand?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:32\nOoh, if I was only doing it by hand.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:35\nYeah, in the old days.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:38\nI think for those 10 interviews, I would at least be producing like just even given now an average, if I'm looking back across all of my projects.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:48\nI would still include like 15 to 18 slides\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:52\nOkay, so now how many, how much content do you generate?\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:58\nWith ChatGPT? Is it more the same or less?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:02\nI would say it's the same ish. And the reason it is the same-ish is because I think like At this point in my research career like this it's almost not expected, but I know what good looks like in terms of like\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:17\nClient reception and things like that. So could I go crazy with chat GPT and give them like a book report? Sure. Do they want it? No.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:56:28\nOkay, so I guess I'm trying to get another question. Do you feel like you actually dedicate the same amount of time, but how many times What do you do with the time that you save like now that you can do the summary in about three minutes and now you have an extra\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:56:41\n57 minutes. What are you going to use that 57 minutes for with a chat tool versus the old way.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:49\nWhat will I use the extra time for? I would use the extra time to ask it more questions.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:57\nSee if I could find something different. See if I could actually make it sound like me.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:02\nBecause I feel like a lot of chat GPT stuff sounds like itself.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:07\nThat makes sense.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:07\nYeah. Okay. I'm interested because you're one of the first subjects that is actually made this transition.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:16\nWhen we went from TV to internet, there was a study of how people use their time.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:16\nOkay.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:21\nMm-hmm.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:21\nAnd, you know, a lot of time, the times it just gets shifted. And I kind of feel like one thesis is that the initial chat, it almost feels like cheating because it's summary setting fast, but I ended up generating far more\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:35\nIt's just been hours and hours and hours and i have volumes of data.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:39\nI don't know if the end result any better, but I do end up spending the same amount of time, but I really probe more with the They may change over time it may get different. But that's why I wanted to delve into that aspect of that. Are there any pitfalls with your process? Have you generated hallucinations that have\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:47\nYeah.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:57\nGotten by your screen.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:02\nSorry, elaborate on that more like\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:58:04\nOh, have you ever done an interview analysis and ask the chat questions about a certain And then it provided answers that in detail looked to be like that role existed. And then in real life, when you went back to check, it didn't exist.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:21\nOh. There's two things. In chat GPT, like the chat GPT from OpenAI, no.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:31\nBut if I was to actually do it through a sidekick or other things like internal Yes.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:58:38\nOkay. And how is your learning understanding? How are you training your eyes to spot I guess they call them hallucinations we might as well too.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:49\nThat is a great question. If it's throwing stuff at me that just sounds weird.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:54\nSo like, for example, if I know that I did not really dive too deep into a certain part of the interview and it was like kind of highlighting it a lot for me.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:04\nThen I've gone back and said like, well, did the person really talk this much about like that aspect? And truthfully, they did not.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:12\nAnd so then I've been curious as to like, you know, where it picked up that info from. And then I've like asked the chat to you know, be like more specific and narrow in And then it's listen to me. The reason I say that OpenAI one is a little bit better is because I feel like it's gotten smarter over time.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:33\nAnd if I'm sending it in a direction, like it just generally tends to like follow, maybe just knows me more. Maybe I don't talk to my sidekick enough. I'm not sure.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:59:41\nOkay. Another section of the interview is who do you consider your collaborators when you're doing a research project?\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 13:59:51\nPeople to work with.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:51\nOh, yeah, absolutely. So yeah, fellow researchers uh If there's people on the client side that like to have an opinion or like research.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:02\nAnd want to be brought along, then definitely them. Leads and executive leadership, like, you know, who want to report out like There are definitely people who would like to be part of the sessions and want to be brought along the story.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:19\nDefinitely part of my team.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:00:21\nOkay, now who do you consider that you work for?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:26\nUm\u2026 the client, whoever that may be.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:00:32\nAnd who benefits most from your work?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:36\nI'd say I really try and like across the board, truly, unless the client has been absolutely closed-minded about it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:44\nAnd even then you push, honestly. I would say that whenever I'm doing research, I genuinely hone in on the user that I'm solving for and they do in the end benefit most from my research, even if it's stuff that the client doesn't want to hear.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:00:57\nOkay, so if I had to say, what's your emphasis of those three, the client, the users, and your coworkers.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:04\nWho would you say is your first priority? And the second priority?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:06\nThe user. Client.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:11\nAnd third.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:12\nMy researchers, but not to say that I don't care about them more to say like.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:18\nGenerally, what I found is that if researchers start out on a research project together, their methodology jives well.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:27\nOkay. What is your victory event?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:31\nOoh, if we have surprised the client with something that they don't know before.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:37\nOkay, very good. Thank you. So you spoke a lot about this. I'm going to talk about four things that end up with um I don't know, I just call this experience framework to have a good experience you need to have these five things so uh\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:54\nWhat do you think the value of your user research is to the client or the world in general.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:02\nI think the world in general, and I teach about this all the time. So what I practice, I preach at night once a week.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:09\nTo call it seniors who are teaching interaction design to. And, you know, this question comes up a lot. Why do you research at all?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:18\nAnd the thing is, and this is where always like kind of bringing myself back to because I've really tried to see other things I have seen products, solutions, things fail if they haven't actually built it from the perspective of the user.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:34\nSo I do think that each and every time And not for nothing If we do research.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:42\nA lot of the answers and the differentiators actually come from our users.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:47\nSo if we're taking the time, even if we're reaching that delta of talking to 10, at least like minimum users of 15, And then we're kind of like, you know, beginning things and kind of dying a knot on our assumptions and things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:02\nIt has built better products and solutions in my mind. So that is the impact of research.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:03:08\nOkay, that's a great answer. So what problem are you solving on a regular basis as a user researcher?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:17\nI think that from a business perspective, the business thinks they know what their client wants and their customers want, but they genuinely don't. They either have like a preconceived notion of it Or like it's outdated, you know.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:30\nAnd so I feel like oftentimes we're helping the businesses understand the latest and greatest of their customers Or\u2026 Again, they are so into their existing products that we're actually helping them breakthrough orthodoxies about their products. They love their products. They have like\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:52\nTunnel vision you know oh my god this is the best website ever. We love it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:57\nMeanwhile, it's like breaking a bar. It's not even doing a thing.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:02\nSo the third thing is data. A lot of times like clients are missing data.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:07\nThey don't know, seriously. Oh my God. The client that I'm on right now Even the one before it, even the For it. No exaggeration. If I have gone and said, can you tell me today what does your user base made out of, right? And these are no small companies I'm talking about. I'm talking about 10, 20 billion a year in revenue.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:29\nAnd they're like, oh, yeah, no, we don't know. And like months go by and I received like no data.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:35\nSo it's like we're helping them really get a better understanding of stuff that they feel like is not important. Meanwhile like if you're not listening to your customer, then who are you selling to is my question.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:04:48\nThat's good. So you mentioned this already, but this is my next question. Who are you trying to educate? And I can tell you're an evangelist. So what are some of your challenges with educating and evangelizing your work.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:04\nI am definitely\u2026 you know, speaking for the user And, you know, defending even if internally as well as externally to the client, the value of why we need to listen to the user and through the research we're doing.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:22\nAnd if people want to come back to me and say, oh, but this is a waste of time. We already know. I'm like, okay, give me the data.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:31\nAnd give me a week and I'll make the decision of like whether you know or not.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:36\nWhether it's viable, right? I agree. You don't need a nine-week research period. Fine.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:41\nBut then give me something to work with. So like my future work is sound.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:45\nYou know what I mean? And that's where the that's where the, you know.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:50\nStarts to crumble because they don't have it or like, you know, it's not sound enough. Or if I'm asking them questions, then they're not able to answer them.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:05:57\nOkay, the next one is what is the core set of tools that you need to get your work done successfully?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:06\nGood question. Honestly, if I'm being like, again, this is the more traditional in me.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:12\nJust need\u2026 the right type of recruiting tool. So like the right type of outreach tool Whether that's if it's virtual, fine. If I'm able to go and like, again, do more spoken word type fine whatever just need the right type of tool to connect me to the right people.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:32\nI need a Zoom call. A recorder. And then just like my hands and my brain but That being said, if I am talking about my current process, I need, yes, still my recruiting I need, you know, A, if it's in person, a recorder. If it's not in person, then yep, recording.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:52\nTranscription, dovetail PowerPoint.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:58\nAnd I'm good to go.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:07:00\nOkay. And so what role does the look and feel of your artifacts present to the How important is that to your work?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:09\nVery important. Very important. Because in the end, like. If it's all over the place, if I have not gone over my flow of my story, my storytelling, things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:23\nRecently have been integrating more like actual snippets from videos where permitted.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:30\nSo impactful. By the way, video is so impactful. Audio is so impactful.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:35\nThat has gone over super well. With clients especially because they hear it coming from the person's mouth, right? Hey.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:43\nHospital. Here's a patient telling you what's wrong with your thing.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:48\nI don't need to at that point, they're doing my job for me. So it's very important. The way that I present is equally as important to the type and quality of work that I'm bringing to them.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:07:58\nOkay, that's great. So if he had a magic wand, what one thing would you use your wish on to improve your work?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:07\nThat's a great question. I feel like I'm super confident in my work. I think that the one thing that keeps on being a variable is the\u2026 having to prove the value of it every time.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:25\nI feel like that conversation looks different every time depending on the client.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:32\nThe outcomes and the way that we You know, the way that we communicate the outcomes and things like that like All of that looks different each time and maybe that's just the nature of the stakeholder management part of it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:47\nSo that's, you know, I would definitely fix that like somehow like If I could magic wand, right? So if I could have a way in which like I could understand the type of client that I'm dealing with and have like almost like a half formed answer as to why this is important for your client.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:03\nThat will be great. And then number two So, and obviously wrap it with like you know, hey, this is not a waste of your time, blah, blah, blah. Fine. The number two would be the whole like what's to come, the AI part of it, right? Like if I could start to see\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:21\nHow it's best augmenting my work And not trying to like kind of, you know, do it for me and even do it for me like in a half baked way and things.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:31\nI'd like to get ahead of that a little bit. I don't know what that looks like yet for me, though.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:36\nOkay, so if I ask a customer to describe Ginza to me in one word.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:41\nWhat one word would you want them to tell me?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:45\nDescribe what in one word, sorry? Okay. Oh, um\u2026\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:47\nYou.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:53\nUm\u2026 intuitive.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:58\nOkay, so are there any questions that you expected me to ask that I haven't asked so far?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:06\nYou asked about discovery. I am curious about the actual\u2026 Oh, no, you did actually. You asked me how I conduct my stuff. You asked me how the output looks like.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:18\nI guess, are you curious at all about client perception or anything else about the Or even like how the insights actually lead into other work or is that out of your scope?\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:10:31\nThose are good questions that inform future interviews because I always ask that to see what, so how would you phrase that into a new section for my interview?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:39\nGreat question. Yeah. I would be like, um.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:44\nYou asked me like, you know, what does a victory moment look like for you?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:50\nI think like I would all, I could make it a jumping off point, right? Like, hey, you've delivered like for me, I've delivered a successful surprise that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:58\nI feel like a lot of times, especially in strategy projects It's like we end on us. So now what Great insights back. What happens next and so It could be that like, you know, you're asking people all right now, how are you taking your insights work and how does it like maybe\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:11:19\nInform next steps for you. So, you know, for me, like it's a roadmap or like, you know, what can come now next and later an ideation workshop, things like that.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:29\nOkay, good, good. Now I'm going to skip to a little bit, a short evaluative session.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:36\nAnd see what we got here. So, you know, we've been working on this tool, Dari. Can you see that? Did I get the right screen?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:11:43\nYes, I see a research dashboard.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:45\nOkay, so research dashboard, just kind of, is this what you would expect for the homepage of a, I mean, we're trying to make a research, an advanced research assistant for for research and interviews.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:57\nWhat would you expect to see on the homepage and um How's this current version living up to that?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:06\nI'm looking. So\u2026\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:15\nOkay, I'm just going to start talking. Because that's what I asked my interviews to do so\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:22\nIs there a way I can give you control of the mouse? I don't even know if I can do that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:27\nI think you probably can. I think underneath more Maybe.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:43\nOkay, I'm going to have to learn how to do that. I don't see it on there.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:46\nLet's keep going. It's more important to get your feedback right now.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:49\nNo problem. Okay, so you're just looking for like, if I, this is what I expect out of a dashboard or a landing page.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:55\nYeah, so we're trying to make a research assistant. What would your research assistant need to accomplish? And this is focusing on the discovery process. And like you said, we're going through opportunities and workshops would be kind of our ending phase\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:13:07\nWell, discovery debrief and opportunity analysis would be like the end. So this is like kickoff to nine weeks in a week in big client meeting with all the goodies.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:18\nSounds good. I love it. So I would say that first of all.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:22\nLet's say that that was my end goal I would love to see, and this is my landing page. I would love to see where I'm in the process today.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:30\nSo it says research dashboard, manage your UX research projects and activities, start a new project.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:37\nIf I already have, okay, resume where you left off. Daria research of researchers research stats is interviews, personas, journey maps artifacts are this activity is this.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:51\nUpcoming milestones, new actions, which is this. Okay. So let's say, for instance, this indicates to me that I may have different research projects going on.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:02\nAt a single time. Let's say, for instance, and if that's the case, then I almost expected to show me like where I am. Maybe it's a timeline. Maybe it's something I expected to show me where I'm in different parts.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:14\nOf my journey for those projects. If\u2026 Yes, absolutely. So, for example, for Novant, I have about for research projects going on right now.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:14:16\nNow, do you ever have more than one research project going on at the same time?\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:14:29\nI typically only have one, so that's just one.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:32\nGotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah. So like, yeah, I have four different work streams. They are all in different parts. Like one of them is in recruiting. One of them is in actual interviewing. One of them is in synthesis.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:43\nOne of them has gone back to the top of the funnel because they concluded one thing and now they're on to another. So it's really different things. So that will be actually great because that's like one view of everything\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:57\nSo yeah, so start a new project is fine. But yes, I'm expecting to see where I am in a more maybe visual way would be helpful.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:15:05\nOkay.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:06\nThan like me trying to track like stats is fine, activities is fine.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:15:13\nLike a nine-week Gantt chart with some top line activities and maybe some milestones and here you are here.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:14\nAt like\u2026\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:15:19\nThat's right.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:20\nDefinitely. And then like, yeah, within that one research project, I would expect quick actions to be there, research stats to be there.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:30\nIf artifacts are related to that one project and that to be there.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:35\nAnd that would be my landing page. If I click into it, then I can probably see a more expanded view.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:42\nOf that project. Enrich, like it's kind of telling me What will be helpful is the following. Let's say I know I've given it some\u2026 I've given it some\u2026\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:58\nKind of overview. I've given it an overview. Hey, this is my project plan I plan to do 10 interviews.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:06\nSo it might tell me I plan to do like, you know.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:10\nSix personas i plan to do I don't know, seven journey maps, whatever.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:15\nIf it's actually telling me all right four of your 10 interviews are done.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:22\nDo our own recruitment. One is confirmed for tomorrow. If it's showing me that stuff, that would be very cool.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:28\nThat's what d scout used to do. And I found it very helpful.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:35\nUm\u2026 It's a little, the quick actions for me new interview upload transcript, create persona, create journey map.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:45\nI almost want that to be reversed. I feel like I would like to see the stats first.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:51\nAnd then I would like to see the quick actions next because It's like, it's giving me where I am.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:16:58\nOkay. Okay.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:02\nAnd then it will like, you know, and then it should ask me resume where you left off or like Hey, for today, like, do you have any updates and then upload transcripts create persona, whatever.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:17:14\nNow, do you actually create like you create a project, do you create like research plans under that? And what's that research document look like?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:22\nYes, so we have a research plan or like think like a project plan in which there is a sub click into a research plan It's a PowerPoint. It has a timeline view, generally a quarter.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:37\nAnd then beyond, but like generally a quarter We have outcomes, we have what we're going to start with we have We actually start with the outcome. So work with our, you know, work backwards. Again, always helping that what is the value we're creating through this type of conversation.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:57\nAnd then what are we going to need? Who do we need? You know, who do we want to talk to?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:02\nSo it's like, it's basically plotting all of that along. And then it's almost like a week by week at that point.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:09\nThat we have all these goals.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:10\nOkay. Do you do an ambition workshop and do you always have an ambition statement?\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:15\nIn your methodology?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:19\nYes, I do.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:21\nOkay. Do you have personas and journey maps as part of your methodology?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:27\nWant to say 95% of the time? Absolutely.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:31\nOkay. And then any kind of opportunity or final workshop\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:36\nOh my goodness, absolutely. So like opportunities Yes, yes. So it's typically ambition workshop research readout Opportunity, which includes like opportunity readout as well.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:38\nAnd then potentially wire frames if there's wireframes in there.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:52\nThen you have ideation workshops, then prioritization workshops, and then roadmap planning.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:58\nDo you have any materials you can share with me that I can kind of study that your methodology, to be quite honest, is a little dominant. I'm familiar with it.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:06\nI was self-taught, so I'm a little self-conscious about my methods. I started at Frog Design with Helmut Esslinger, who did the first plastic television.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:14\nAnd then he did the Max Snow White, the one piece macintosh design language and then Disney Cruise. So I learned to talk to real people the way German industrial designers do.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:25\nBut nothing existed in school. I was actually in the room with Business Week and Hartman when they created the term persona and scenario design.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:19:27\nWow.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:33\nWas supposed to be instead of journey map. But Persona kept stuck to this day.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:39\nAnd it was just a throwaway line in an interview with Business Week. And then\u2026 So it's interesting to see that. But sometimes I feel like an imposter because I have not had the training to even write a research plan and ask you, you start with a question. I mean, I do it instinctively, but I don't.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:57\nAnd when I come across people that have retraining, I'm always impressed and I always learn from you.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:03\nThat's fantastic. Oh my God. I'm starstruck. Wow. Yes. No, I mean, that's beautiful. Again, Stephen, to be honest with you, like.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:17\nAlways, always on the lookout. I know that that's what I was trained in.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:21\nBut, you know, I was on the lookout for like more and more flexible, especially again i feel like the Doblin method is beautiful. I've actually applied it you know in business and also like personal lives to make my relationship better. Seriously, I know people like laugh about that when I say that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:37\nFor now, even like teach my students or like, you know, plan again from the smallest of things to the biggest of things\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:20:42\nYeah, the way they basically create a vocabulary that's that's Similar to any UX methodology, but owned.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:20:49\nBy them. And that's kind of what Hartman's goal was. It's like you you want to like if it's the color palette you don't want to use You want to make your own colors. They're slightly different and identifiable.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:20:59\nAnd that's kind of how I see their methodology. That's what I appreciate about how they position it and go to market and they\u2026 You know, they're really intentional about their Word choice.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:13\nAbsolutely. And\u2026 And I do think like, and then I go back to I just feel a little annoyed, I think is the word that you know while i appreciate and i appreciate Again, I'm not super, super old.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:31\nYou know i i just No.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:21:32\nYeah, I am.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:34\nBut like, I just, whenever I hear now my master's degree students who ask for mentorship or like even my bachelor's degree, you know, people\u2026 It's like somehow the world has just like kind of glossed over the fact that like you still need research\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:50\nAnd like just gone immediately to like what I feel like are buzzwords Which is like conversational AI or like AI this or like, you know, inclusive design that and blah, blah, blah.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:02\nI didn't understand it, but like you're missing an entire piece in the middle, which is like actual design thinking methodology in which like research methodology is a crucial component of how to think about all of this and strategy for that matter.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:17\nSo hearing\u2026\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:17\nI think a few new pages. Okay, this is just, I need to have a better input. And do you think I could get away with one input form that would account for a new project, a new research, and a new interview or do they need to be different forms?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:35\nLet's start new.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:35\nThis is the new interview form and it just copied over as a project.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:41\nPre-interview information, research your name, role, email, phone.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:45\nAnd this is something that I realized I don't actually run the same script almost every time, but I think ahead of time.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:52\nLike today, we're kind of doing more of a persona background When I showed this to other researchers, like, Stephen, I don't have a different, I don't know what you're saying. And that's when I realized\u2026 I've been doing this for like six weeks as a bench project. And it just occurred to me that\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:05\nI need to do user research with user researchers. Thank you.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:09\nYeah, yeah.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:11\nBecause not everybody thinks like me. And I have learned so much already from the short number of interviews. It's amazing.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:14\nFair.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:21\nRight. No, I'm a fan. I don't care what anybody says. If you're not doing research.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:28\nMight as well not do the project truly. But I know\u2026\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:30\nAnd this one I broke, but thinking through this. I want this to be like probably my project, but these are the cards. And so an interview transcript would be a card. And you can tell me from dovetail.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:41\nBut I'm thinking of meeting notes. You know, your kickoff deck, any of these things would be one of these cards and they'd have a different name up here. And the reason is that we throw these into a vector store. And once they're in a vector store, you can do, and I don't have this tuned yet.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:57\nBut I can do\u2026 I think I broke it.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:01\nYeah, I did break it. I can do sentiment searches and mood searches. And that's what I'm going to focus on is making it so that you can go through these articles and you can upload a bunch instead of three.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:16\nAnd then you can choose from there. Let's see if we get Priscilla. This one, I've got two models you can pick from But if I pick the first, I've got two interviews that I've done in here. I'll put yours in here also.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:24:24\nHmm.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:29\nAnd then, so the idea is that you'd have these artifacts and you'd select them And then you choose a model and potentially the prompt. But right now I'm just using the prompt I've put through there.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:24:41\nRight.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:42\nGives you a baseline of stuff that you could export to Figma.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:47\nYou can drag and drop it. And then you're going to probably still do most of your work in Figma.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:52\nBut at least you have this way to manage a bunch of transcripts and interviews, generate access to a model.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:59\nTo run some prompts and to get it formatted Persona.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:06\nThat you can, you know, and I could actually ask it for more right now. They're just from one bullet each time.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:25:13\nThat is neat. And have you checked like if it is\u2026 giving you\u2026 like, yeah, like, is it true to what you would\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:24\nYeah, it's pretty good. And then, okay, so that's one tool. And then the same thing with journey maps. Now on the other front, I'm working on these custom GPTs for Sidekick. And this is Thicia, the persona builder, Odicia, the journey map builder.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:39\nActually, the limitation here is you can only put in two transcripts so that's t three transcripts and then you're done\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:25:48\nGot it.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:51\nI hope that sees it. Okay, so those are the same two transcripts and then um\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:10\nOkay, custom GPTs are fancy words. So you take the regular GPT that Chad has or whatever, Genesis.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:16\nAnd then you basically write some custom prompts and then you upload like best practice documents. So I uploaded all of the Northwest Credit Union personas because they gave us permission to. And so it'll reference those and generate It's still going.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:34\nAnd this is probably a little more robust than my other tool, but it's really just a content. It didn't just On my laptop.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:26:44\nI like, Stephen, this gives you such a great like you know starting point to that It's almost stupid on my end if I don't use it. You know what I mean? Just to even like check.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:58\nYeah. And this one's actually better because you have this canvas tool that they have where you can actually edit. And so you can enter a conversation, you get your initial journey map And then you can hit into Canvas and you can say\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:15\nUh\u2026\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:31\nSo what features do they want on the homepage of the discovery tool? And that's the question we ask.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:27:40\nRight.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:45\nSo you can actually have a continued conversation and you can actually go through here. I want three bullets. You can use this sidebar to add and remove content.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:56\nNow, it doesn't really transition to Figma as well. I'm trying to get that where it would give you a nice template.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:05\nWhereas I do have it over here on this tool, I have an export to Figma working on a different version where Makes a nice drag and drop Figma.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:14\nStarting point. But I was over here trying to make this so you could edit it.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:18\nI had added a chat conversation. But then I saw this and it just quit their tool was so much better. Magic wand button, blah, blah, blah, trigger workflow shortcuts.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:31\nSo these are also tools that we're going to bring out.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:35\nKind of working in parallel. Any thoughts you have on that type of approach?\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:28:42\nI think that that again helps take some cognitive load off of me.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:28:49\nAnd get more. This is what I love so far about ChatGPT.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:28:56\nIn a world where I'm overwhelmed, it's actually showing me new ways to think. And that's why I like it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:03\nSo, you know, all of this, what you just did, right? Like whether asking about features or like even just like first go and things like that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:11\nI genuinely feel like it's kind of doing some of that heavy lifting for me and I personally love it.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:17\nAnd now if I kind of like, again, spend the time to make it more nuanced and make it more you know detailed or special or whatever.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:25\nYou know, now I have more cognitive space to do that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:30\nAnd I actually enjoy that a lot.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:29:32\nInteresting. See what I did here? I did wrong. That's crazy. I can't believe I did that.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:38\nWhat happened?\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:29:46\nI ask it to do a journey map and it's not the journey map tool it's the um It's the persona tool.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:51\nOh, it's the\u2026 One two.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:29:55\nThat's fascinating. I did not\u2026 I did not mean to do that, but it's interesting. I had to compare these results.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:05\nBecause the other tool is just customized. I was wondering, I was looking at stuff, it looks kind of funny Interesting. Okay.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:14\nIt's like one of the weird aha moments you get while you're Doing this stuff.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:21\nBecause it did a decent job on it. It's not the journey map tool.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:24\nThat's crazy. But this was really great. I'm so sorry. I do have a client.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:29\nI've kept you too long, yeah.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:30\nNo, no, no, you're good. You're good. I mean, I really enjoyed this and loved your questions. Thank you so much for spending the time. I'm so curious to see Daria turns out, truly.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:42\nOkay. And one of these days I'll probably want to get, I'm trying to specifically avoid outset and dovetail for now.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:48\nOkay. Yep. Makes sense.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:49\nAnd I'm not unduly influenced and just copying stuff. I'm just trying to be blue sky and listen to the users and kind of build features based on what people say.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:58\nThe right way to do it.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:58\nAnd of course, based on when I say diverse past was like my dream tool. But then I realized it's not everybody as a researcher, researchers like I do.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:11\nYeah, this is a much more detailed persona. And I like this too. You can do the image prompt and then throw it into one of the image generators on Firefly.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:31:21\nMm-hmm.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:21\nGet a crazy image. Thank you so much for your time today.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:31:25\nOf course, of course. Thank you for taking the time. And yeah, please keep us updated.\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:29\nI will, I will. Any questions or thoughts, note them down and pass them my way.\n\n[Kasher, Kinza] 14:31:31\nThank you. Definitely. Thank you\n\n[Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:35\nThank you\n\n",

I'm doing fine. Thank you so much for spending time with me today.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:31:40 Of course, of course.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:31:42 Now, the obligatory, do I have your permission to make a transcript and to do a recording?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:31:48 Yes, definitely. And just as an FYI, my internet is suffering today and I've been saving on bandwidth wherever I can.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:31:50 Okay.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:31:58 If you cut out and can't hear me, just let me know.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:32:01 Okay. Okay, it should be fine.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:01 And\u2026 Come back on.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:32:06 So do you have any questions before we start? Okay. Well, thank you for the time with me. Can you tell me how long have you been a user researcher?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:09 No, this is great. Thank you for connecting.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:17 For sure. Absolutely. It's been a now seven years. Oh.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:32:23 Now, who do you have like how did you learn? How did you become a user researcher? Do you have any influential people that got you started or  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:30 I actually went to school for it. Yes. My MFA is in interaction design. Interaction design is a holistic degree. A part of that degree, like about six or seven months or so, we had rigorous training in user research.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:45 I had many mentors and professors along the way that inspired me.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:49 They had their learnings from their mentors and everything that inspired them.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:32:53 So yeah, happy and lucky to have been part of a cohort that really inspired like essentially the just enough research to start right as a designer For America Hall. But yeah, that was my beginnings and it was Onwards from there.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:04 Yep.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:10 And how long have you been at Deloitte?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:12 Four years in February this year.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:15 Okay, so what's your current responsibility and roles?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:19 Yeah, I am the design ops lead at Novant Health. I've been on this account now for a year and two months. I lead their design ops team it is a team of researchers, strategists, designers About me about 14 people on the team so far.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:39 Across all shores, so US, ADMX and USI.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:33:43 Okay, that's fascinating. Now, with respect to your roles and responsibilities, what is your primary goal?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:33:49 Oh, yes, for sure. So my primary goal is to make sure that all of our projects are being delivered With excellence. And these projects are ranging, I want to say about 40. So I lead about eight or nine different projects for that  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:08 Client and think like different work streams and I want to say about 45 to 55% of it has research in it. So it could be like grounds up discovery Or it could be evaluative.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:22 Or it could be a mix. And then the rest is like.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:27 More design based ideation based and delivery based.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:34:32 Okay, with respect to your primary goal, what are some key frustrations that you encounter?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:37 This delivery with excellence. I think\u2026 Right now, it's more about the skill gap that sometimes our junior resources, especially across the USI shores They are not very adept at research as well as analysis, synthesis, that side of the house.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:34:57 So it's a lot of like hand-holding when it comes to actually delivering the work. I think that's a pain point.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:05 I'm finding that, sorry, excuse me, I'm finding that research in general as a People think they know it, but they really don't, you know, in the most like core of its meaning. What do I mean by that is like.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:22 You know um they think that they know how to use your test You know, that they've done enough kind of like, you know, tries and they're hitting on the right things, but it's really not the truth.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:33 You know, it's like it's pretend research, unfortunately.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:38 That doesn't really tell you everything. So I would say that, you know, that's one of my biggest pain points and I actually brought on a co-lead with me from Applied Design.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:35:49 And, you know, thankfully she had more of a research background and has been helping me kind of, you know, mentor the team really you know all the way from like creating interview guides to how to run interviews to analysis, synthesis  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:36:02 You know and then actually rewarding out So I'm finding like, you know, a lot of people think they know research, but they don't  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:36:11 Okay. Well, that sounds good. So let's go back to when you started eight to six years ago. How did you consider what kind of tools and how did you consider your understanding of planning a research project?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:36:21 Yeah. Oh my goodness. So it was like very greenfield to me, right? Like it was um So I come from like a marketing background and for me like research was like, oh, you know, think competitive research, think client research, think like market research and things like that. So it was very like um  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:36:37 Marketing based. And when I got into UX or user experience You know, kind of was like, oh, everything is from a consumer perspective still but you know instead of like focusing on how to sell to them. It's like what works for them. And so the tools that started to become available to me were definitely, again, as part of my master's degree.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:00 I went to, I was directed to books, right? I was directed to books in which like it was about, you know, learning different methodologies. So qual, quant.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:12 Ethnographic. Evaluative.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:16 And so depending on the different projects. Our professors actually helped us navigate you know based on scope and timing and what was actually involved? What is the objective to determine the right type of a methodology or a methodology I guess like formula  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:36 And, you know, back then, I would say\u2026 there were not a lot of like user testing tools. I'm not saying that they weren't there, but I would say that I saw a more of like a focus on how to use those or like  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:37:53 How to use the virtual tools and more of the kind of now what we know to be usertesting.com, dovetail.com, which I lead here.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:03 That really happened after COVID, I would say. Before COVID, we were more used to like, oh, let's go out into the field and let's do that type of research and things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:12 You know, planning was in person. So like all the way from, you know, oh, an outline to an interview guide to You know, how are we going to go and recruit people? It was very much like.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:22 Non-virtual. And now I feel like even after quote unquote the pandemic.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:28 I feel like it has remained virtual or at least has been my kind of experience so far but also like if I talk to my colleagues and peers in the research world and other deck or, you know.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:38:43 Firms, it sounds like they are following similar standards still as well. So the boom of tools like usertesting.com etc has remained, I'd say.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:38:53 Okay, so that's good. I'm also assuming that summarizes how you do research now in the last two years and how it's changed.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:02 Yes. Wow. So I definitely see it changing and being evolved by the use of AI because it's happening real time right now.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:39:03 What do you see in the next three years changing?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:15 Even in our own firm You know, like there was so much emphasis about, you know, how to conduct the perfect interview perfect i say you know the core of leave assumptions at the door, like, you know, come with this like mindset  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:30 There was so much great emphasis on like, you know, the art and the method of conducting research And I feel like now, which is good. I am for it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:41 Because again, I view AI as a tool rather than an enemy, to be honest with you. But now we have things like Outset that will perform the interview for you. And it kind of like, at first it set off alarm bells because I was like, oh my God.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:39:54 You know, how are people going to react to a robot asking them questions, for example?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:00 But the truth of the matter is that that's where that's where we're going. I do think like that's going to be shaped now the quality of the output is yet to be determined. I don't know about it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:15 Enough yet. I haven't played around it myself you know enough yet.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:20 But I do think like, you know, now having contributed to research for these types of duels, whether it's like at the top of the funnel of the research, whether it's planning, conducting.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:29 Or the output, right? The analysis of synthesis, I do think like it will be it will be faster through tools in certain processes, but it does need human evaluation and an eye I also am curious, I'll be honest, this is an open thing in my mind is that  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:48 I don't know. I don't know what the world of research is going to perceive us as perceive quality research anymore.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:40:57 So what do I mean by that is that previously, or at least like again growing up school design methodology, even application like My interview at Dublin or delo back then was based on like, how do I take my insights and produce something good out of it right so  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:18 Now I wonder, like, even if Outset, for example, can conduct 500 interviews for me at a given time.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:25 You know, what am I really looking to make out of that. You know, previously, if I would have done like I was on a project that we did 60 interviews and we had a team of like six You know, I remember that being really valuable to the client.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:40 Now I wonder if like 500 is even needed. I don't know.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:44 So it's like all these like different questions that I do have in my mind, I'll be honest with you i But yeah, I kind of like\u2026 You know, I am being taken along this ride and I'm welcoming it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:41:58 And contributing to it where I can.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:42:02 That sounds great. So can you think of a story where you had a research assignment or research project that you wanted to do. And no matter how hard you tried at every turn, it became complicated and frustrating and had a bad outcome.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:14 Ooh, that's a great question. Let me think. Really quickly here.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:25 Hmm. Um\u2026 Okay, so that 50 to 60 interview one, right?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:35 I'll actually go back to that. Not trying to be hypocritical but I do think there were parts of it in which If there is an output that's already predetermined.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:46 So the implementation over there was that we were going to, for example.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:42:52 Implement a Salesforce solution for the client anyway. We knew what the output was before an eight month project.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:00 And our practice sold again heavy lift on research anyway.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:07 So we ended up kind of like, you know, doing this awesome, you know, it was a bank.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:11 And we were supposed to interview about six or seven types of roles there. Think like everything from an analyst to a lead lead.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:19 And, you know, director, senior director whatever And we ended up actually, while we enjoyed talking to and creating those personas and things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:31 Even journeys to that point, it was such a nightmare trying to prove the value of it all to the client.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:38 Especially after we've solved for that. So, you know, it did not have a bad outcome. But what I will say is that like we had to sell our work after having sold our work and saying like while we're doing like this amazing stuff for you, look at this value  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:43:54 They were bringing and you know clients would actually get on the call and like for people who are like, why are you telling me about all of this stuff you know and like you would you would like kind of have to educate them before you told them about this awesome work you did  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:09 In the end, again, they saw the value, but we had to prove the value like every day. It was crazy.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:44:15 That sounds good. Now, can you think of a story where you had a project that They came out with a really happy ending that has a nice project and it surprised you with how people came together And had a good result.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'd say thankfully a lot of my projects are like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:32 So I'm grateful that again like and this is before though, like, I don't know what happens now When I say now, I really mean like an outside-led project, for example. But, you know, like if we are planning and kind of contribute like the messaging and the  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:44:50 We're there to control how it's going. I know how to pivot in an interview if I'm not liking how the conversation is going and like, you know, the, again, the emotion of the person, the comfort level of the person. I know all of that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:05 So, you know, I would say that thankfully, like a lot of my research projects have been knock on wood successful.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:11 However, there was one project nationwide that I did in which like we had very limited kind of scope of interviews and things like that you know the client actually was very tough because they had researchers on their And, you know, we had to  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:29 We had to work with them and they were so particular. They were so particular. Like he would, this guy was a PhD in some sort of research methodology and he would come back with questions that would boggle our minds.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:41 And so, you know, talk about like overeducated and having to prove our value but It was such a happy outcome because he actually liked the way that we did research, did interviews, things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:45:52 In the end was super happy with the outcome because we were able to kind of like you know bring that to the table and do it cleanly, he said.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:00 So, yeah.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:46:01 Okay, that's a great story. So now I want to kind of step back and talk about how you plan a discovery because this is kind of like a There's two of them working on is going to try to support the discovery activities for a team.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:46:12 And so can you kind of walk through the beginning? What are some of the things you consider? What are some of the inputs when you're planning maybe a nine-week discovery project?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:23 Absolutely. So when we're planning for like, let's say a nine-week discovery project, that sounds very much in length, actually.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:31 It's a lengthy discovery given like Again, I'm talking from a scope that I've seen from You know, Deloitte, for example, because, you know, it's like, I feel like more and more We have had to fight to lengthen discovery. And so, you know, nine weeks sounds luxurious. So I'll start.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:46:51 The type of inputs we'd be looking for, depending on, again, like regardless of actually whatever industry whatever You know, kind of um I guess like type of discovery let's say we are going green field inputs from stakeholders, key kind of like, you know, outcomes and KPIs, key impact. A lot of our businesses think that they already know everything.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:15 So, you know, kind of getting into their minds and, you know, seeing, all right, like if you're okaying a nine week discovery, what does that mean for you?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:23 You know, so it's like discovery with the stakeholder is so important. Then recruiting the right  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:47:27 How much of your time is spent managing those files and what do you do with those inputs once you get them from the client?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:35 I think that we, so like the interviews or the discovery with the stakeholder is an active discussion Lately, in all of my projects, it's been dovetail.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:49 A lot of my stuff goes into Dovetail because that's my go-to for analysis and synthesis.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:47:54 And so it almost starts to become a repository for me.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:47:58 Okay, get back to where you were. I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just wanted to get a little\u2026 Right.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:00 Oh, no, no, of course. So that's number one. Number two, download of the different types of users that we're going to be solving for.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:11 And then start to actually recruit. So one of my tools becomes then of my tools any type of recruiting services we have, some that I've worked with in the past with Deloitte. We don't have descout anymore, but it used to be  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:24 One of my top favorite tools because it made recruiting so easy It made screening so easy. It made payments so easy.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:35 This guy was great. Lately, if I want to go a little bit more expert interviewee, like let's say if I am interviewing executives or more high net worth or again, depending on like the type of criteria, I've also used glg  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:48:52 So, you know, I'm doing like outreach to them I am planning\u2026 Definitely a timeline in which I'm communicating clear milestones and goals to the client. Like, hey, client.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:05 At the very least, I'm going to check in with you every week. We're going to have X amount of work done.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:11 These are the outcomes you can expect at every You know, turn, depending on how hands-on hands off the client is part of the discoveries, I would include like, you know, at least two like working sessions or think workshops with the client  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:26 Some of it could be semi readout some of it could be like debriefs with the 5060.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:32 Interview project. We used to have debriefs at 4 p.m. Every day.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:36 Because we'd be conducting four interviews Every day. So kind of like shaping as the story goes along It's so key I would say extended discovery projects.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:49 We would do competitive research. So as part of our desk research.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:49:54 We would definitely like think about the topic, think about competition think about what's already existing out there.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:01 And all of that actually gets bundled in the same repository with my primary research as well.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:50:08 Are you putting that into dovetail these days? Okay. And so before How much time did you spend analyzing transcripts versus now that you have Dovetail?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:11 Yes.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:19 I would say that um With Dovetail, what changed was, well, there used to be a time where we didn't even have transcript generators until Otter came around and things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:32 And the thing is, I'm not that, that old, but I do know that  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:50:36 I know it's changed so fast. I do remember just taking hand notes and how much time you spent with those to get your analysis?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:40 Oh, yeah. Definitely. Oh my God. Definitely.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:47 And now that we have things like transcripts and dovetail and things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:50:51 Yes, like I'm still uh so dovetail doesn't actually auto generate any insights or anything for you. They're trying, but they're not  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:50:58 Have you tried like chat gbt to generate insights or summaries?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:02 Yeah, I have.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:51:04 The first time, how did you feel the first time that you took a transcript and you generated summaries using an AI tool?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:10 I thought it was\u2026 crazy. I thought it was crazy. In a good way. I really do think that I thought that it was like a good thing.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:20 I double checked my work. But honestly, and yes, I guess the more nuanced questions I asked it around, you know, what I There was two things. So the original or the kind of like more traditional researcher in me you know uh was like.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:40 If I am, actually, I'll go the opposite. Sorry, bear with me. So the new researcher or the person who wants to get insights and I know what are the different types of insights the client is looking for or will be valuable to my project or like  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:51:56 I know that like our leadership even has interest in Obviously, I was asking you questions about that and was giving me what I wanted.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:04 But the traditional researcher in me likes to kind of like go through the transcript and look for those surprises or look for those tidbits that like are, you know, stood out in research and things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:16 And that to me is what I missed the first time I did do a chat GPT generated You know, kind of insights back, if that makes sense so  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:52:27 Do you think that you change your listening behavior in interviews now that you know you're going to have a summary and how has it changed?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:33 Oh, yeah.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:39 Oh, I feel like it's almost like, and I don't want it to sound negative but There's a certain muscle that you exercise when you're doing analysis and synthesis.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:52:51 And which is critical thinking. And I feel like having a chat GPT or something like that Not that I'm not smart about it, but the thing is I might be more comfortable not looking in depth, if that makes sense.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:53:07 And I feel like that muscle in me is less sharper the more I do rely on a chat GPT.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:53:16 Now, how much time before ChatGPT, how much time did you spend sifting through a transcript to get a general summary that you could share with somebody?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:53:27 I spend, and I can tell you, so for about 10 interviews, let's say If I had no meetings And if I could have heads down time, I would do it in five to seven business days.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:53:39 Now, how much time, if you had those same 10 interviews with ChatGPT, How much time would you spend join the analysis that you could share with the client.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:53:49 I would say two to three days. And even after Dovetail, I would say like that five to seven days was actually it brought it was brought down to three to four days because I'm almost like making connections as I'm doing the analysis through those interviews.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:07 And so it's allowing me to like tag and, you know, already built like mini insights And then kind of ladder up to like a lot.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:14 Now with those 10 interviews, how much time would it take for you to get the kind of the summaries that you got by hand?  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:22 Four.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:24 Oh, um. How much time would it take me? Bye.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:28 Yeah, if you had the chat GPT at 10 interviews, think of the quality that you did in that one week period.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:36 And try to compare it to how long that would take you to get to that level of detail.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:36 Uh-huh.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:54:41 With the chat tool.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:41 Got it. Got it. I think\u2026 I think\u2026 I think it would take me, I would still want it like from actual creation to like delivery. It would take me four to five days still.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:54:55 Because I'm the kind of person and I don't mean this in a proud way, but I do know myself like it would make me anxious knowing I missed something if I didn't double check the work, if that makes sense. Like I'm definitely not one of those people that says, all right, I'm uploading these 10  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:10 I'm just going to put whatever I can and do the thing.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:13 And I'm good. It would drive me crazy. I would actually not be able to sleep at night if I did not double check the work.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:21 Okay, so now let's do one other thing. So when you originally generated those 10 summaries, how much pages in a Word document did you generate from those 10 interviews by hand?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:32 Ooh, if I was only doing it by hand.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:35 Yeah, in the old days.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:38 I think for those 10 interviews, I would at least be producing like just even given now an average, if I'm looking back across all of my projects.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:55:48 I would still include like 15 to 18 slides  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:52 Okay, so now how many, how much content do you generate?  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:55:58 With ChatGPT? Is it more the same or less?  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:02 I would say it's the same ish. And the reason it is the same-ish is because I think like At this point in my research career like this it's almost not expected, but I know what good looks like in terms of like  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:17 Client reception and things like that. So could I go crazy with chat GPT and give them like a book report? Sure. Do they want it? No.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:56:28 Okay, so I guess I'm trying to get another question. Do you feel like you actually dedicate the same amount of time, but how many times What do you do with the time that you save like now that you can do the summary in about three minutes and now you have an extra  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:56:41 57 minutes. What are you going to use that 57 minutes for with a chat tool versus the old way.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:49 What will I use the extra time for? I would use the extra time to ask it more questions.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:56:57 See if I could find something different. See if I could actually make it sound like me.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:02 Because I feel like a lot of chat GPT stuff sounds like itself.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:07 That makes sense.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:07 Yeah. Okay. I'm interested because you're one of the first subjects that is actually made this transition.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:16 When we went from TV to internet, there was a study of how people use their time.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:16 Okay.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:21 Mm-hmm.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:21 And, you know, a lot of time, the times it just gets shifted. And I kind of feel like one thesis is that the initial chat, it almost feels like cheating because it's summary setting fast, but I ended up generating far more  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:35 It's just been hours and hours and hours and i have volumes of data.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:39 I don't know if the end result any better, but I do end up spending the same amount of time, but I really probe more with the They may change over time it may get different. But that's why I wanted to delve into that aspect of that. Are there any pitfalls with your process? Have you generated hallucinations that have  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:57:47 Yeah.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:57:57 Gotten by your screen.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:02 Sorry, elaborate on that more like  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:58:04 Oh, have you ever done an interview analysis and ask the chat questions about a certain And then it provided answers that in detail looked to be like that role existed. And then in real life, when you went back to check, it didn't exist.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:21 Oh. There's two things. In chat GPT, like the chat GPT from OpenAI, no.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:31 But if I was to actually do it through a sidekick or other things like internal Yes.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:58:38 Okay. And how is your learning understanding? How are you training your eyes to spot I guess they call them hallucinations we might as well too.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:49 That is a great question. If it's throwing stuff at me that just sounds weird.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:58:54 So like, for example, if I know that I did not really dive too deep into a certain part of the interview and it was like kind of highlighting it a lot for me.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:04 Then I've gone back and said like, well, did the person really talk this much about like that aspect? And truthfully, they did not.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:12 And so then I've been curious as to like, you know, where it picked up that info from. And then I've like asked the chat to you know, be like more specific and narrow in And then it's listen to me. The reason I say that OpenAI one is a little bit better is because I feel like it's gotten smarter over time.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:33 And if I'm sending it in a direction, like it just generally tends to like follow, maybe just knows me more. Maybe I don't talk to my sidekick enough. I'm not sure.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:59:41 Okay. Another section of the interview is who do you consider your collaborators when you're doing a research project?  [Dulaney, Stephen] 13:59:51 People to work with.  [Kasher, Kinza] 13:59:51 Oh, yeah, absolutely. So yeah, fellow researchers uh If there's people on the client side that like to have an opinion or like research.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:02 And want to be brought along, then definitely them. Leads and executive leadership, like, you know, who want to report out like There are definitely people who would like to be part of the sessions and want to be brought along the story.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:19 Definitely part of my team.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:00:21 Okay, now who do you consider that you work for?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:26 Um\u2026 the client, whoever that may be.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:00:32 And who benefits most from your work?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:36 I'd say I really try and like across the board, truly, unless the client has been absolutely closed-minded about it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:00:44 And even then you push, honestly. I would say that whenever I'm doing research, I genuinely hone in on the user that I'm solving for and they do in the end benefit most from my research, even if it's stuff that the client doesn't want to hear.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:00:57 Okay, so if I had to say, what's your emphasis of those three, the client, the users, and your coworkers.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:04 Who would you say is your first priority? And the second priority?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:06 The user. Client.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:11 And third.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:12 My researchers, but not to say that I don't care about them more to say like.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:18 Generally, what I found is that if researchers start out on a research project together, their methodology jives well.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:27 Okay. What is your victory event?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:01:31 Ooh, if we have surprised the client with something that they don't know before.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:37 Okay, very good. Thank you. So you spoke a lot about this. I'm going to talk about four things that end up with um I don't know, I just call this experience framework to have a good experience you need to have these five things so uh  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:01:54 What do you think the value of your user research is to the client or the world in general.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:02 I think the world in general, and I teach about this all the time. So what I practice, I preach at night once a week.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:09 To call it seniors who are teaching interaction design to. And, you know, this question comes up a lot. Why do you research at all?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:18 And the thing is, and this is where always like kind of bringing myself back to because I've really tried to see other things I have seen products, solutions, things fail if they haven't actually built it from the perspective of the user.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:34 So I do think that each and every time And not for nothing If we do research.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:42 A lot of the answers and the differentiators actually come from our users.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:02:47 So if we're taking the time, even if we're reaching that delta of talking to 10, at least like minimum users of 15, And then we're kind of like, you know, beginning things and kind of dying a knot on our assumptions and things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:02 It has built better products and solutions in my mind. So that is the impact of research.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:03:08 Okay, that's a great answer. So what problem are you solving on a regular basis as a user researcher?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:17 I think that from a business perspective, the business thinks they know what their client wants and their customers want, but they genuinely don't. They either have like a preconceived notion of it Or like it's outdated, you know.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:30 And so I feel like oftentimes we're helping the businesses understand the latest and greatest of their customers Or\u2026 Again, they are so into their existing products that we're actually helping them breakthrough orthodoxies about their products. They love their products. They have like  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:52 Tunnel vision you know oh my god this is the best website ever. We love it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:03:57 Meanwhile, it's like breaking a bar. It's not even doing a thing.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:02 So the third thing is data. A lot of times like clients are missing data.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:07 They don't know, seriously. Oh my God. The client that I'm on right now Even the one before it, even the For it. No exaggeration. If I have gone and said, can you tell me today what does your user base made out of, right? And these are no small companies I'm talking about. I'm talking about 10, 20 billion a year in revenue.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:29 And they're like, oh, yeah, no, we don't know. And like months go by and I received like no data.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:04:35 So it's like we're helping them really get a better understanding of stuff that they feel like is not important. Meanwhile like if you're not listening to your customer, then who are you selling to is my question.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:04:48 That's good. So you mentioned this already, but this is my next question. Who are you trying to educate? And I can tell you're an evangelist. So what are some of your challenges with educating and evangelizing your work.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:04 I am definitely\u2026 you know, speaking for the user And, you know, defending even if internally as well as externally to the client, the value of why we need to listen to the user and through the research we're doing.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:22 And if people want to come back to me and say, oh, but this is a waste of time. We already know. I'm like, okay, give me the data.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:31 And give me a week and I'll make the decision of like whether you know or not.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:36 Whether it's viable, right? I agree. You don't need a nine-week research period. Fine.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:41 But then give me something to work with. So like my future work is sound.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:45 You know what I mean? And that's where the that's where the, you know.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:05:50 Starts to crumble because they don't have it or like, you know, it's not sound enough. Or if I'm asking them questions, then they're not able to answer them.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:05:57 Okay, the next one is what is the core set of tools that you need to get your work done successfully?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:06 Good question. Honestly, if I'm being like, again, this is the more traditional in me.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:12 Just need\u2026 the right type of recruiting tool. So like the right type of outreach tool Whether that's if it's virtual, fine. If I'm able to go and like, again, do more spoken word type fine whatever just need the right type of tool to connect me to the right people.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:32 I need a Zoom call. A recorder. And then just like my hands and my brain but That being said, if I am talking about my current process, I need, yes, still my recruiting I need, you know, A, if it's in person, a recorder. If it's not in person, then yep, recording.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:52 Transcription, dovetail PowerPoint.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:06:58 And I'm good to go.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:07:00 Okay. And so what role does the look and feel of your artifacts present to the How important is that to your work?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:09 Very important. Very important. Because in the end, like. If it's all over the place, if I have not gone over my flow of my story, my storytelling, things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:23 Recently have been integrating more like actual snippets from videos where permitted.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:30 So impactful. By the way, video is so impactful. Audio is so impactful.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:35 That has gone over super well. With clients especially because they hear it coming from the person's mouth, right? Hey.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:43 Hospital. Here's a patient telling you what's wrong with your thing.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:07:48 I don't need to at that point, they're doing my job for me. So it's very important. The way that I present is equally as important to the type and quality of work that I'm bringing to them.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:07:58 Okay, that's great. So if he had a magic wand, what one thing would you use your wish on to improve your work?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:07 That's a great question. I feel like I'm super confident in my work. I think that the one thing that keeps on being a variable is the\u2026 having to prove the value of it every time.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:25 I feel like that conversation looks different every time depending on the client.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:32 The outcomes and the way that we You know, the way that we communicate the outcomes and things like that like All of that looks different each time and maybe that's just the nature of the stakeholder management part of it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:08:47 So that's, you know, I would definitely fix that like somehow like If I could magic wand, right? So if I could have a way in which like I could understand the type of client that I'm dealing with and have like almost like a half formed answer as to why this is important for your client.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:03 That will be great. And then number two So, and obviously wrap it with like you know, hey, this is not a waste of your time, blah, blah, blah. Fine. The number two would be the whole like what's to come, the AI part of it, right? Like if I could start to see  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:21 How it's best augmenting my work And not trying to like kind of, you know, do it for me and even do it for me like in a half baked way and things.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:31 I'd like to get ahead of that a little bit. I don't know what that looks like yet for me, though.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:36 Okay, so if I ask a customer to describe Ginza to me in one word.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:41 What one word would you want them to tell me?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:45 Describe what in one word, sorry? Okay. Oh, um\u2026  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:47 You.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:09:53 Um\u2026 intuitive.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:09:58 Okay, so are there any questions that you expected me to ask that I haven't asked so far?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:06 You asked about discovery. I am curious about the actual\u2026 Oh, no, you did actually. You asked me how I conduct my stuff. You asked me how the output looks like.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:18 I guess, are you curious at all about client perception or anything else about the Or even like how the insights actually lead into other work or is that out of your scope?  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:10:31 Those are good questions that inform future interviews because I always ask that to see what, so how would you phrase that into a new section for my interview?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:39 Great question. Yeah. I would be like, um.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:44 You asked me like, you know, what does a victory moment look like for you?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:50 I think like I would all, I could make it a jumping off point, right? Like, hey, you've delivered like for me, I've delivered a successful surprise that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:10:58 I feel like a lot of times, especially in strategy projects It's like we end on us. So now what Great insights back. What happens next and so It could be that like, you know, you're asking people all right now, how are you taking your insights work and how does it like maybe  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:11:19 Inform next steps for you. So, you know, for me, like it's a roadmap or like, you know, what can come now next and later an ideation workshop, things like that.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:29 Okay, good, good. Now I'm going to skip to a little bit, a short evaluative session.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:36 And see what we got here. So, you know, we've been working on this tool, Dari. Can you see that? Did I get the right screen?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:11:43 Yes, I see a research dashboard.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:45 Okay, so research dashboard, just kind of, is this what you would expect for the homepage of a, I mean, we're trying to make a research, an advanced research assistant for for research and interviews.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:11:57 What would you expect to see on the homepage and um How's this current version living up to that?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:06 I'm looking. So\u2026  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:15 Okay, I'm just going to start talking. Because that's what I asked my interviews to do so  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:22 Is there a way I can give you control of the mouse? I don't even know if I can do that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:27 I think you probably can. I think underneath more Maybe.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:43 Okay, I'm going to have to learn how to do that. I don't see it on there.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:46 Let's keep going. It's more important to get your feedback right now.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:12:49 No problem. Okay, so you're just looking for like, if I, this is what I expect out of a dashboard or a landing page.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:12:55 Yeah, so we're trying to make a research assistant. What would your research assistant need to accomplish? And this is focusing on the discovery process. And like you said, we're going through opportunities and workshops would be kind of our ending phase  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:13:07 Well, discovery debrief and opportunity analysis would be like the end. So this is like kickoff to nine weeks in a week in big client meeting with all the goodies.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:18 Sounds good. I love it. So I would say that first of all.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:22 Let's say that that was my end goal I would love to see, and this is my landing page. I would love to see where I'm in the process today.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:30 So it says research dashboard, manage your UX research projects and activities, start a new project.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:37 If I already have, okay, resume where you left off. Daria research of researchers research stats is interviews, personas, journey maps artifacts are this activity is this.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:13:51 Upcoming milestones, new actions, which is this. Okay. So let's say, for instance, this indicates to me that I may have different research projects going on.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:02 At a single time. Let's say, for instance, and if that's the case, then I almost expected to show me like where I am. Maybe it's a timeline. Maybe it's something I expected to show me where I'm in different parts.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:14 Of my journey for those projects. If\u2026 Yes, absolutely. So, for example, for Novant, I have about for research projects going on right now.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:14:16 Now, do you ever have more than one research project going on at the same time?  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:14:29 I typically only have one, so that's just one.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:32 Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah. So like, yeah, I have four different work streams. They are all in different parts. Like one of them is in recruiting. One of them is in actual interviewing. One of them is in synthesis.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:43 One of them has gone back to the top of the funnel because they concluded one thing and now they're on to another. So it's really different things. So that will be actually great because that's like one view of everything  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:14:57 So yeah, so start a new project is fine. But yes, I'm expecting to see where I am in a more maybe visual way would be helpful.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:15:05 Okay.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:06 Than like me trying to track like stats is fine, activities is fine.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:15:13 Like a nine-week Gantt chart with some top line activities and maybe some milestones and here you are here.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:14 At like\u2026  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:15:19 That's right.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:20 Definitely. And then like, yeah, within that one research project, I would expect quick actions to be there, research stats to be there.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:30 If artifacts are related to that one project and that to be there.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:35 And that would be my landing page. If I click into it, then I can probably see a more expanded view.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:42 Of that project. Enrich, like it's kind of telling me What will be helpful is the following. Let's say I know I've given it some\u2026 I've given it some\u2026  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:15:58 Kind of overview. I've given it an overview. Hey, this is my project plan I plan to do 10 interviews.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:06 So it might tell me I plan to do like, you know.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:10 Six personas i plan to do I don't know, seven journey maps, whatever.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:15 If it's actually telling me all right four of your 10 interviews are done.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:22 Do our own recruitment. One is confirmed for tomorrow. If it's showing me that stuff, that would be very cool.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:28 That's what d scout used to do. And I found it very helpful.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:35 Um\u2026 It's a little, the quick actions for me new interview upload transcript, create persona, create journey map.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:45 I almost want that to be reversed. I feel like I would like to see the stats first.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:16:51 And then I would like to see the quick actions next because It's like, it's giving me where I am.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:16:58 Okay. Okay.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:02 And then it will like, you know, and then it should ask me resume where you left off or like Hey, for today, like, do you have any updates and then upload transcripts create persona, whatever.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:17:14 Now, do you actually create like you create a project, do you create like research plans under that? And what's that research document look like?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:22 Yes, so we have a research plan or like think like a project plan in which there is a sub click into a research plan It's a PowerPoint. It has a timeline view, generally a quarter.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:37 And then beyond, but like generally a quarter We have outcomes, we have what we're going to start with we have We actually start with the outcome. So work with our, you know, work backwards. Again, always helping that what is the value we're creating through this type of conversation.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:17:57 And then what are we going to need? Who do we need? You know, who do we want to talk to?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:02 So it's like, it's basically plotting all of that along. And then it's almost like a week by week at that point.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:09 That we have all these goals.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:10 Okay. Do you do an ambition workshop and do you always have an ambition statement?  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:15 In your methodology?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:19 Yes, I do.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:21 Okay. Do you have personas and journey maps as part of your methodology?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:27 Want to say 95% of the time? Absolutely.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:31 Okay. And then any kind of opportunity or final workshop  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:36 Oh my goodness, absolutely. So like opportunities Yes, yes. So it's typically ambition workshop research readout Opportunity, which includes like opportunity readout as well.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:38 And then potentially wire frames if there's wireframes in there.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:18:52 Then you have ideation workshops, then prioritization workshops, and then roadmap planning.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:18:58 Do you have any materials you can share with me that I can kind of study that your methodology, to be quite honest, is a little dominant. I'm familiar with it.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:06 I was self-taught, so I'm a little self-conscious about my methods. I started at Frog Design with Helmut Esslinger, who did the first plastic television.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:14 And then he did the Max Snow White, the one piece macintosh design language and then Disney Cruise. So I learned to talk to real people the way German industrial designers do.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:25 But nothing existed in school. I was actually in the room with Business Week and Hartman when they created the term persona and scenario design.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:19:27 Wow.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:33 Was supposed to be instead of journey map. But Persona kept stuck to this day.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:39 And it was just a throwaway line in an interview with Business Week. And then\u2026 So it's interesting to see that. But sometimes I feel like an imposter because I have not had the training to even write a research plan and ask you, you start with a question. I mean, I do it instinctively, but I don't.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:19:57 And when I come across people that have retraining, I'm always impressed and I always learn from you.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:03 That's fantastic. Oh my God. I'm starstruck. Wow. Yes. No, I mean, that's beautiful. Again, Stephen, to be honest with you, like.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:17 Always, always on the lookout. I know that that's what I was trained in.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:21 But, you know, I was on the lookout for like more and more flexible, especially again i feel like the Doblin method is beautiful. I've actually applied it you know in business and also like personal lives to make my relationship better. Seriously, I know people like laugh about that when I say that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:20:37 For now, even like teach my students or like, you know, plan again from the smallest of things to the biggest of things  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:20:42 Yeah, the way they basically create a vocabulary that's that's Similar to any UX methodology, but owned.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:20:49 By them. And that's kind of what Hartman's goal was. It's like you you want to like if it's the color palette you don't want to use You want to make your own colors. They're slightly different and identifiable.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:20:59 And that's kind of how I see their methodology. That's what I appreciate about how they position it and go to market and they\u2026 You know, they're really intentional about their Word choice.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:13 Absolutely. And\u2026 And I do think like, and then I go back to I just feel a little annoyed, I think is the word that you know while i appreciate and i appreciate Again, I'm not super, super old.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:31 You know i i just No.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:21:32 Yeah, I am.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:34 But like, I just, whenever I hear now my master's degree students who ask for mentorship or like even my bachelor's degree, you know, people\u2026 It's like somehow the world has just like kind of glossed over the fact that like you still need research  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:21:50 And like just gone immediately to like what I feel like are buzzwords Which is like conversational AI or like AI this or like, you know, inclusive design that and blah, blah, blah.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:02 I didn't understand it, but like you're missing an entire piece in the middle, which is like actual design thinking methodology in which like research methodology is a crucial component of how to think about all of this and strategy for that matter.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:17 So hearing\u2026  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:17 I think a few new pages. Okay, this is just, I need to have a better input. And do you think I could get away with one input form that would account for a new project, a new research, and a new interview or do they need to be different forms?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:35 Let's start new.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:35 This is the new interview form and it just copied over as a project.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:22:41 Pre-interview information, research your name, role, email, phone.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:45 And this is something that I realized I don't actually run the same script almost every time, but I think ahead of time.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:22:52 Like today, we're kind of doing more of a persona background When I showed this to other researchers, like, Stephen, I don't have a different, I don't know what you're saying. And that's when I realized\u2026 I've been doing this for like six weeks as a bench project. And it just occurred to me that  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:05 I need to do user research with user researchers. Thank you.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:09 Yeah, yeah.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:11 Because not everybody thinks like me. And I have learned so much already from the short number of interviews. It's amazing.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:14 Fair.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:21 Right. No, I'm a fan. I don't care what anybody says. If you're not doing research.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:23:28 Might as well not do the project truly. But I know\u2026  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:30 And this one I broke, but thinking through this. I want this to be like probably my project, but these are the cards. And so an interview transcript would be a card. And you can tell me from dovetail.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:41 But I'm thinking of meeting notes. You know, your kickoff deck, any of these things would be one of these cards and they'd have a different name up here. And the reason is that we throw these into a vector store. And once they're in a vector store, you can do, and I don't have this tuned yet.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:23:57 But I can do\u2026 I think I broke it.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:01 Yeah, I did break it. I can do sentiment searches and mood searches. And that's what I'm going to focus on is making it so that you can go through these articles and you can upload a bunch instead of three.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:16 And then you can choose from there. Let's see if we get Priscilla. This one, I've got two models you can pick from But if I pick the first, I've got two interviews that I've done in here. I'll put yours in here also.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:24:24 Hmm.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:29 And then, so the idea is that you'd have these artifacts and you'd select them And then you choose a model and potentially the prompt. But right now I'm just using the prompt I've put through there.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:24:41 Right.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:42 Gives you a baseline of stuff that you could export to Figma.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:47 You can drag and drop it. And then you're going to probably still do most of your work in Figma.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:52 But at least you have this way to manage a bunch of transcripts and interviews, generate access to a model.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:24:59 To run some prompts and to get it formatted Persona.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:06 That you can, you know, and I could actually ask it for more right now. They're just from one bullet each time.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:25:13 That is neat. And have you checked like if it is\u2026 giving you\u2026 like, yeah, like, is it true to what you would  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:24 Yeah, it's pretty good. And then, okay, so that's one tool. And then the same thing with journey maps. Now on the other front, I'm working on these custom GPTs for Sidekick. And this is Thicia, the persona builder, Odicia, the journey map builder.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:39 Actually, the limitation here is you can only put in two transcripts so that's t three transcripts and then you're done  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:25:48 Got it.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:25:51 I hope that sees it. Okay, so those are the same two transcripts and then um  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:10 Okay, custom GPTs are fancy words. So you take the regular GPT that Chad has or whatever, Genesis.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:16 And then you basically write some custom prompts and then you upload like best practice documents. So I uploaded all of the Northwest Credit Union personas because they gave us permission to. And so it'll reference those and generate It's still going.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:34 And this is probably a little more robust than my other tool, but it's really just a content. It didn't just On my laptop.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:26:44 I like, Stephen, this gives you such a great like you know starting point to that It's almost stupid on my end if I don't use it. You know what I mean? Just to even like check.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:26:58 Yeah. And this one's actually better because you have this canvas tool that they have where you can actually edit. And so you can enter a conversation, you get your initial journey map And then you can hit into Canvas and you can say  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:15 Uh\u2026  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:31 So what features do they want on the homepage of the discovery tool? And that's the question we ask.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:27:40 Right.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:45 So you can actually have a continued conversation and you can actually go through here. I want three bullets. You can use this sidebar to add and remove content.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:27:56 Now, it doesn't really transition to Figma as well. I'm trying to get that where it would give you a nice template.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:05 Whereas I do have it over here on this tool, I have an export to Figma working on a different version where Makes a nice drag and drop Figma.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:14 Starting point. But I was over here trying to make this so you could edit it.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:18 I had added a chat conversation. But then I saw this and it just quit their tool was so much better. Magic wand button, blah, blah, blah, trigger workflow shortcuts.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:31 So these are also tools that we're going to bring out.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:28:35 Kind of working in parallel. Any thoughts you have on that type of approach?  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:28:42 I think that that again helps take some cognitive load off of me.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:28:49 And get more. This is what I love so far about ChatGPT.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:28:56 In a world where I'm overwhelmed, it's actually showing me new ways to think. And that's why I like it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:03 So, you know, all of this, what you just did, right? Like whether asking about features or like even just like first go and things like that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:11 I genuinely feel like it's kind of doing some of that heavy lifting for me and I personally love it.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:17 And now if I kind of like, again, spend the time to make it more nuanced and make it more you know detailed or special or whatever.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:25 You know, now I have more cognitive space to do that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:30 And I actually enjoy that a lot.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:29:32 Interesting. See what I did here? I did wrong. That's crazy. I can't believe I did that.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:38 What happened?  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:29:46 I ask it to do a journey map and it's not the journey map tool it's the um It's the persona tool.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:29:51 Oh, it's the\u2026 One two.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:29:55 That's fascinating. I did not\u2026 I did not mean to do that, but it's interesting. I had to compare these results.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:05 Because the other tool is just customized. I was wondering, I was looking at stuff, it looks kind of funny Interesting. Okay.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:14 It's like one of the weird aha moments you get while you're Doing this stuff.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:21 Because it did a decent job on it. It's not the journey map tool.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:24 That's crazy. But this was really great. I'm so sorry. I do have a client.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:29 I've kept you too long, yeah.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:30 No, no, no, you're good. You're good. I mean, I really enjoyed this and loved your questions. Thank you so much for spending the time. I'm so curious to see Daria turns out, truly.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:42 Okay. And one of these days I'll probably want to get, I'm trying to specifically avoid outset and dovetail for now.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:48 Okay. Yep. Makes sense.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:49 And I'm not unduly influenced and just copying stuff. I'm just trying to be blue sky and listen to the users and kind of build features based on what people say.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:30:58 The right way to do it.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:30:58 And of course, based on when I say diverse past was like my dream tool. But then I realized it's not everybody as a researcher, researchers like I do.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:11 Yeah, this is a much more detailed persona. And I like this too. You can do the image prompt and then throw it into one of the image generators on Firefly.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:31:21 Mm-hmm.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:21 Get a crazy image. Thank you so much for your time today.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:31:25 Of course, of course. Thank you for taking the time. And yeah, please keep us updated.  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:29 I will, I will. Any questions or thoughts, note them down and pass them my way.  [Kasher, Kinza] 14:31:31 Thank you. Definitely. Thank you  [Dulaney, Stephen] 14:31:35 Thank you  ",
