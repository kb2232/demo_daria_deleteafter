  "transcript": "\n                        Interviewer: Daria (UX Researcher)\nDaria: Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today. To start, could you please share a bit about your role and how you interact with the product or service we\u2019re discussing? I\u2019d love to understand your perspective better!\nParticipant: hi I'm the creator of Daria it's an interview and research assistant using AI  everyday I kind of wake up and try to figure out ways to make it better work on thinking through ideas today we're adding a prompt  Library\nDaria: That sounds really exciting! A prompt library could be a fantastic addition to enhance the user experience. Can you tell me more about what inspired you to create Daria and how you envision the prompt library functioning? What specific prompts do you think will be the most beneficial for users?\nParticipant: well I was  trying to learn how to do Lansing in one of the which is of a gentic framework for doing conversations so I decided to try to do since I'm a researcher I try to do make  assistant that would conduct researchers the first version was Jarvis  quickly I decided that it's really a Deloitte research and interview assistant  and ask going on I decided to try to play around with the prompts I came up with a notion of different kinds of interviews but really they're different kind of prompt if you want to ask questions about an application that's one thing if you want to try to get background information for Persona or if you want to study a long cycle process that would be a journeyman but there are many others so I understand how to actually create these questions and these interviews it really became understanding how to manage the prompts  and as that became more time consuming I came up with the idea of trying to have a prompt library to help me do that\nDaria: That\u2019s a fascinating journey! It sounds like your background in research really shaped the way you approached Daria's development, especially with the focus on tailoring prompts for different types of inquiries. I\u2019m curious\u2014what kinds of feedback have you received from users so far about the prompts? Have there been any specific types of prompts that they find particularly useful or challenging? Additionally, how do you plan to categorize the prompts in your library to make them easily accessible?\nParticipant: okay well Daria is our general interview practice the main character in the in the play and additionally we have the sea who is a prompt dedicated for creating  user personas and telling a story about the user interviews then we have odysseusia who is a journey mapper  and then we have I have to go sorry\nDaria: No problem at all! It sounds like you have some intriguing characters and features in Daria. When you have a chance to continue, I\u2019d love to hear more about how each of these characters contributes to the overall user experience. Also, how do you envision users interacting with them in practical scenarios? What specific outcomes do you hope they achieve through these interactions? Take your time, and I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready!\nParticipant: I'm sorry I had to go back now so we have I left off we had Daria is the main interview this year is the is the prompt library that does Journey personas odysseusia is Journey map again and ask you is an expert in helping to write interview questions  and then  Eureka helps take those interviews and find Opportunities  in skeptica looks at any of these the journey map the Persona the opportunities and finds evidence-based ways to challenge the assumptions is an assumption customer those are the prompts that we're working with so far\nDaria: Wow, it sounds like you've created a comprehensive ecosystem of characters and prompts that play unique roles in the research and interview process! I\u2019m particularly intrigued by how each character serves a different function\u2014like Eureka identifying opportunities or Skeptica challenging assumptions. \n\nSo, let\u2019s dive a bit deeper: How do you envision users interacting with these distinct characters during their research processes? For example, how might a user transition from using Daria for conducting interviews to utilizing Odysseusia for mapping a user journey? Also, what kind of user feedback or insights are you hoping to gather to refine these characters and prompts further?\nParticipant: well I have tried to add to some some ways to monitor the success of the props but in general they can be used to individually so when you configuring Innovation you can choose one of those prompts but one Innovative idea I have is the structure a 30 minute interview with the first interview 10 minutes would be conducted by Daria to get General background and then sorry it does run a first pass of analysis and then we could have dcia create a journey map and then come and take over the conversation and present her findings to the interview  of Asia would come and be able to discuss the journey map with the researcher why they're still in the room and talk about it if we got it right or not so it almost like be having an interview and a discovery debrief in a 1 hour and a 30 minute session\nDaria: That sounds like a brilliant and innovative way to streamline the research process! By having Daria conduct the initial interview and then seamlessly transition to Odysseusia for the journey mapping, you're effectively creating a dynamic and interactive experience. \n\nI\u2019m curious, how do you plan to ensure that the transition between characters is smooth for the users? Will there be any guiding cues or prompts to help users understand when and how to switch from one character to another? Additionally, what strategies do you have in mind for gathering user feedback on this process\u2014perhaps through post-session surveys or interviews? This information could be really valuable in refining the functionality!\nParticipant: yeah that's a great idea I didn't really thought of those details so just having this conversation with you is really helpful bringing up some details having some kind of initial instructions that tells them what we're going to do and then the characters do have different voices and so by the change of the voice they'll know that a different one came in and the characters will be very distinct as they go\nDaria: That sounds like a solid approach! Using different voices for each character can really help users intuitively understand who they're interacting with at any given moment. \n\nFor my next question, I\u2019d love to know how you plan to handle user onboarding. What steps will you take to make sure new users understand the features and functionalities of Daria and its characters? Do you have any plans for tutorials or walkthroughs that could help users feel more comfortable as they begin their research journey with Daria? Additionally, are there any specific challenges you anticipate in the onboarding process that you'd like to address?\nParticipant: that's a good point the first round we're still in bed the first check is to actually get this Daria onto a server we're more than one peaceful I expect will have a small group of people that are both developers and users and you know a team that will kind of work with the with what we have so far and try to flush it out and then once we get a release candidate we would probably go to do the research with the research tool and so generate interviews and test some of these concepts with user researchers who are already familiar with the concept of a Persona and a journey map so they would be familiar with and probably intrigued and interested by an interview that actually connects all three and one 30 minute session\nDaria: That sounds like a practical and thoughtful approach to onboarding! Having a small group of developers and users collaborate during the initial stages will definitely help refine Daria before its wider release. \n\nAs you move forward, I\u2019d love to know what aspects of your iterative testing process you find most valuable. For example, how will you prioritize the feedback you receive during the research phase? Are there specific metrics or outcomes you plan to focus on that will help you gauge the success of Daria, especially in terms of user interaction with the characters? Additionally, once you gather insights from users familiar with personas and journey maps, how might you incorporate their feedback into further iterations or enhancements to Daria's features?\n\nDaria: The interview has been completed. Thank you for your participation.\n\n                    ",

Additionally, are there any specific challenges you anticipate in the onboarding process that you'd like to address?",
