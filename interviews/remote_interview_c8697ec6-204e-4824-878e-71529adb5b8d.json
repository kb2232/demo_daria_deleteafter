  "transcript": "Interviewer: Daria (UX Researcher)\nDaria: Hello! I\u2019m excited to chat with you today. Can we start by getting a bit of background about you? What\u2019s your name and what is your role?\nParticipant: Steven Delaney I am a ux researcher at Deloitte  now you remember that this is the actual interview that's going on it's actually still recording so I'm just going to say\nDaria: Great to meet you, Steven Delaney! It\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019re a UX researcher at Deloitte. Your role must involve a lot of interesting projects. Can you share a bit about a recent project you've worked on? What were some of the challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?\nParticipant: currently working on a project called Daria it's a remote interview management system Daria allows users to create links to conduct interviews and then you can see right here this is the monitor link so you can actually watch the end of your from your office you can suggest questions you can watch the semantic analyzer as I get more positive it will get positive as I get Negative it will get negative so part of the project is to conduct the interview create the transcripts but we're not done there yet after you create the interview you have to start to analyze the transcripts and that's where much of the work is so I'm going to be quiet for a little bit\nDaria: That sounds like a fascinating project, Steven! The ability to monitor interviews in real-time and analyze transcripts must add significant value for researchers. I\u2019d love to hear more about the analysis phase. What methods or tools are you using to analyze the transcripts, and how do you ensure that the findings are actionable for your stakeholders? Have you encountered any specific challenges during this analysis process?\nParticipant: yes definitely got transcripts is really just the first part once you capture the transcripts we need a way to upload them into the system so this is an import transcript screen that's back over here this is the regular Darius system you go to import I preloaded this to save a little bit of time but then from here you can pick files off of your main drive and I have pre-loaded some Daria transcripts that we took today  I can't tell which one's better  this one looks pretty good but let's see which one has a lot of quality that's what's better so we're going to take the top one interview transcript  okay and then now we have that transcript up here we're going to upload that transcript  and you can see it it loaded the transcript into the Daria system so analyst is the next part of the system I'm going to be quiet for 3 seconds so the monitor can capture my answers\nDaria: That\u2019s really interesting, Steven! It sounds like you have a well-defined workflow for managing the transcripts. Once the transcripts are uploaded, what steps do you take to analyze the data? Do you have specific metrics or methodologies you apply to extract insights? Also, how do you ensure that the analysis aligns with your stakeholders' goals and objectives?\nParticipant: well the key feature is that we can go to the archive and we should see the interview that we just right here this is the ux interview that we just uploaded I can verify there's Daria there's the transcript that's an important part of the transcript but with ux people they want to actually go through and analyze and the semantic intent of each part we call that Affinity mapping so I'm going to be quiet for 3 seconds so that Daria can capture this part of the presentation\nDaria: That sounds like a solid approach, Steven! Affinity mapping can be such a powerful method for synthesizing qualitative data and identifying key themes or insights from user interviews. How do you facilitate the affinity mapping process? Do you involve other team members in this phase, and if so, how do you ensure that everyone\u2019s insights are captured and considered? Additionally, how do you transform those insights into actionable recommendations for your stakeholders?\nParticipant: these insights will be captured and this is the part of the group part of anyone that's on my team can have access to these interviews these two that are just uploaded they haven't been Affinity map there's a special process in the background that creates the chunking it goes through the interview and it takes parts of it into conversations that are logical and then it has time stamp so we can get through and then it scores them with it mostly neutral emotion it'll score them with an inside tag or a research method so we'll try to find one here that's  pretty common I don't know if that's going to be important but let's see  one will jump out of me to  oh this one's going to be positive so we'll take research answers now let's look at the advanced search which is another key feature I'm going to be quiet so that text can analyze for 3 seconds\nDaria: Thank you for sharing that process, Steven! It sounds like you have a comprehensive system in place for analyzing the transcripts and capturing important insights. I'm curious about the advanced search feature you mentioned. Can you elaborate on how that works and how it aids in your analysis process? What kind of filters or criteria can you apply to find specific information in the transcripts? Additionally, how do you prioritize insights once they have been identified?\n\nDaria: The interview has been completed. Thank you for your participation.\n",
