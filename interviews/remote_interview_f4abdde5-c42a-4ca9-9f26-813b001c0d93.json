Can you start by telling me a bit about what you do and what your primary goals are in your role?\nParticipant: hi there start the interview\nDaria: Great! Let's dive right in. Can you share what motivated you to pursue your current role? Was there a specific experience or inspiration that led you to this path?\nParticipant: I  was in frog design as a systems integrator and I started to work with heartburn and he started to kind of show me how you do phase zero Discovery and after that I was on the path of being a customer researcher\nDaria: That\u2019s an interesting journey! It sounds like your experience at frog design and your collaboration with Heartburn had a significant impact on your career path. Can you describe a particular project or research initiative you worked on as a customer researcher that you found especially rewarding? What were some key insights you gained from that experience?\nParticipant: when I was visiting the Sunnyvale office watching one of the new younger industrial designers work on a chick razor and how much care and concern they put in with the packaging and also watching how they did their debriefs and how they set their assumptions in the at Birth they think about the user first and then they talk about certain things when they're reviews very disciplined very strict and everybody knew the procedure they're all trained in the same methodology and it was fascinating to watch and that was very influential on the way I approach projects\nDaria: That sounds like a valuable experience! It's great to hear how observing the designers' focus on user-centric principles and their disciplined approach to methodology influenced your own work. Given that experience, how do you incorporate user feedback into your research process and project development? Can you share any specific methods or tools you use to gather and analyze that feedback?\nParticipant: well we conduct individual interviews I've got to developed a script I use which is open-ended qualitative script ask a lot of deep questions during that script there's one phase where I go through the specifics of any particular product design and kind of get a baseline of how they approach the problem how they think the problem I'm trying to understand their mental models and their decision framework that helps them interact with with whatever problem we're trying to solve\nDaria: That sounds like a sophisticated approach! Understanding mental models and decision frameworks is crucial for effective design. Can you tell me about a specific challenge you faced while conducting these interviews, and how you overcame it? Additionally, were there any unexpected insights that emerged from these conversations that impacted your project?\n\nDaria: The interview has been completed. Thank you for your participation.\n",
