# Daria Interview Tool - RC2 Status Report

## Current Status: STABLE

As of May 5, 2025, the Daria Interview Tool Release Candidate 2 is in a stable state with all core functionality working. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system's current status, known issues, and recommendations for future development.

## Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Main API Server | ✅ Stable | `run_interview_api.py` is working correctly |
| Text-to-Speech | ✅ Stable | ElevenLabs integration working via `simple_tts_service.py` |
| Speech-to-Text | ✅ Stable | Using browser-based Web Speech API instead of server-side |
| Character System | ✅ Stable | All character personas loading properly |
| Remote Interview | ✅ Stable | Remote interview flow working end-to-end |
| Interview Termination | ✅ Stable | Auto-detection and graceful termination working |

## Recent Improvements

1. **Web Speech API Integration**: Successfully replaced server-side STT with browser-based Web Speech API
2. **Character Selection Fix**: Resolved issue with character dropdown not showing available options
3. **Interview Termination**: Added proper API endpoints for interview termination
4. **Auto-close Feature**: Implemented countdown timer for browser windows after interview completion
5. **Debug Information**: Added debug panel for troubleshooting interviews

## Known Issues

1. **Prompt Manager Errors**: Some errors when viewing certain character prompts (e.g., Synthia)
   - Error: `'list object' has no attribute 'items'`
   - May need to fix prompt format or view logic

2. **Missing Favicon**: 404 errors for favicon.ico
   - Low priority UI issue

3. **ElevenLabs STT API**: Server-side STT with ElevenLabs API is not fully implemented
   - Current workaround: Using browser Web Speech API instead

## Running the System

### Start Services

```bash
./start_services.sh
```

This will start:
- Main API server on port 5010
- TTS service on port 5015

### Clean Shutdown

```bash
./cleanup_services.sh
```

### Key URLs

- Dashboard: http://localhost:5010/dashboard
- Interview Setup: http://localhost:5010/interview_setup
- Interview Archive: http://localhost:5010/interview_archive
- Prompt Manager: http://localhost:5010/prompts/

## Git Status

The project is currently on the `release-candidate-2` branch. There are several modified and untracked files that should be committed to finalize RC2. Run `git status` to see these files.

## Recommendations

1. **Commit current changes**: Finalize RC2 by committing all working changes to the `release-candidate-2` branch
2. **Fix Prompt Manager**: Resolve the issue with viewing certain character prompts
3. **Add favicon**: Create and add a proper favicon.ico to eliminate 404 errors
4. **Documentation**: Update all documentation to reflect current implementation details
5. **Testing**: Conduct comprehensive testing of all interview flows before final release

## Next Steps

Before finalizing RC2, consider the following actions:

1. Run comprehensive tests with all character personas
2. Document any remaining issues in RELEASE_NOTES.md
3. Create a proper favicon.ico file
4. Fix the Prompt Manager view for Synthia character
5. Commit all changes to the release-candidate-2 branch

## Restoring from this State

If you need to restore the system to its current working state:

1. Check out the `release-candidate-2` branch
2. Run `./cleanup_services.sh` to ensure no lingering processes
3. Run `./start_services.sh` to start services
4. Access the system at http://localhost:5010 

# RC2 Status Report - May 6, 2025

## Today's Progress

### 1. Fixed Remote Session Conversation Flow

We've made substantial improvements to the remote interview session functionality:

- Fixed issues where conversation wasn't continuing properly after user responses
- Added automatic generation of AI responses in the backend
- Implemented message polling to ensure continued conversation flow
- Added improved silence detection and user response handling
- Created loading indicators and proper error handling during conversations
- Fixed TTS (Text-to-Speech) integration to provide voice responses

These changes ensure that when a participant joins a session and provides responses, the AI interviewer properly continues the conversation by asking follow-up questions.

### 2. Discussion Guide Management Enhancements

We've implemented new features to better manage discussion guides in the system:

- Added permanent deletion capability for archived guides
- Implemented a guide status filter (All/Active/Archived) in the guides list
- Enhanced the UI with proper confirmation modals for destructive actions
- Created backend services to handle guide lifecycle management
- Added safety mechanisms to preserve session data even when guides are deleted

### 3. LangChain Conversation Quality Improvements

We've significantly enhanced the quality of AI-driven conversations, resulting in better interviews and analysis:

- Improved context management for more coherent follow-up questions
- Enhanced character-specific prompting for better persona consistency 
- Added automated response generation with error handling
- Implemented real-time polling for smoother conversation flows
- Improved analysis generation with better prompt handling

A comprehensive documentation of these improvements has been created in LANGCHAIN_IMPROVEMENTS.md.

### 4. Interface Improvements

We've enhanced the UI to provide better transparency and usability:

- Added AI Character name display in all session interfaces
- Improved session status indicators
- Enhanced loading states and visual feedback
- Added audio visualization for microphone activity
- Implemented better silence detection UI with visual countdowns

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing the remote session functionality with multiple users
2. Consider implementing bulk actions for discussion guides
3. Add session export functionality for analysis in external tools
4. Enhance the analytics dashboard with more visualizations

## Technical Implementations

- Added `delete_guide()` method to `DiscussionService`
- Created new API endpoint `/api/discussion_guide/<guide_id>/delete`
- Added UI components for filtering and permanent deletion
- Enhanced `session_remote.html` with improved conversation handling
- Implemented auto-response generation in the `add_session_message` API endpoint
- Added `generate_response` method to `InterviewService` for better AI conversations
- Enhanced UI templates to show AI Character information
