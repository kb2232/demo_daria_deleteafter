# Daria Interview Tool - RC2 Technical Guide

## Overview

Release Candidate 2 (RC2) of the Daria Interview Tool represents a stable version with all core functionality working. This document provides a technical overview of the system architecture, key improvements, and guidance for developers.

## Architecture

The Daria Interview Tool consists of the following core components:

1. **Main API Server (`run_interview_api.py`)**: 
   - Flask-based API server running on port 5010
   - Handles interview session management and API endpoints
   - Integrates with prompt management system

2. **Text-to-Speech Service (`audio_tools/simple_tts_service.py`)**:
   - Standalone service running on port 5015
   - Integrates with ElevenLabs API for high-quality voice synthesis
   - Simple REST API for text-to-speech conversion

3. **Client-Side Speech Recognition**:
   - Uses Web Speech API in the browser
   - Replaces previous server-side speech-to-text implementation
   - Provides more reliable speech recognition

4. **Character System**:
   - YAML-based character definition in `tools/prompt_manager/prompts/`
   - Configurable prompts, evaluation metrics, and analysis templates
   - Supports multiple interview personas (Daria, Skeptica, etc.)

5. **Web UI**:
   - HTML/JavaScript-based interfaces for interview setup and execution
   - Remote interview capabilities with real-time transcription
   - Debug information panel for troubleshooting

## Key Improvements in RC2

1. **Web Speech API Integration**:
   - Replaced server-side speech-to-text with browser-based implementation
   - Improved reliability and reduced API dependencies
   - Simplified processing pipeline

2. **Character Selection Fix**:
   - Resolved issue with dropdown not displaying available characters
   - Improved character parameter passing through URL
   - Fixed default character assignment in interview sessions

3. **Interview Termination**:
   - Added detection for phrases like "end interview"
   - Implemented proper API endpoints (`/api/interview/end`)
   - Added graceful session cleanup and summary generation

4. **Auto-Close Feature**:
   - Added countdown timer for browser windows at interview end
   - Improved user experience with clear session termination
   - Displays thank you message after completion

5. **Debug Information**:
   - Added panel for troubleshooting character and prompt issues
   - Displays loaded prompt information and system state
   - Helps identify configuration problems in real-time

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Service health check and version information |
| `/api/interview/start` | POST | Start a new interview session |
| `/api/interview/respond` | POST | Process user input and generate response |
| `/api/interview/end` | POST | End an interview session |
| `/api/text_to_speech_elevenlabs` | POST | Convert text to speech using ElevenLabs |
| `/api/speech_to_text` | POST | Process speech (now passthrough to browser API) |
| `/api/characters` | GET | List available character personas |
| `/api/character/<name>` | GET | Get specific character information |
| `/api/check_services` | GET | Check if required services are running |

## Configuration

The system uses the following configuration:

- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: Required for text-to-speech functionality
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI responses (when LangChain is enabled)

- **Character Prompts**:
  - Located in `tools/prompt_manager/prompts/`
  - YAML format with standardized fields
  - Configurable system prompts and evaluation metrics

## Developer Guide

### Starting the Services

```bash
./start_services.sh
```

This starts:
- Main API server on port 5010
- TTS service on port 5015

### Clean Shutdown

```bash
./cleanup_services.sh
```

### Testing Character Prompts

```bash
python3 test_prompt_loading.py
```

This validates all character prompt files and checks for format issues.

### Fixing Character Prompts

If you encounter issues with character prompts:

1. Ensure `evaluation_metrics` is formatted as a dictionary, not a list
2. Verify all required fields are present
3. Use the test script to validate changes

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Prompt Manager Display Issues**:
   - Some complexity with YAML parsing and display
   - Fixed Synthia prompt to use dictionary format instead of list

2. **Missing Favicon**:
   - Created placeholder in `static/favicon.ico`
   - Should be replaced with proper binary .ico file

3. **ElevenLabs STT API**:
   - Server-side implementation is incomplete
   - Currently using browser-based Web Speech API instead

4. **Flask Development Server**:
   - Current implementation uses Flask development server
   - Not suitable for production deployment
   - Would need to be deployed with WSGI server like Gunicorn

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining issues in the Prompt Manager
2. Create production deployment configuration
3. Implement comprehensive test suite
4. Add persistent storage for interview transcripts
5. Implement proper authentication system
