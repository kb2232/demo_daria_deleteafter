This may involve loading any necessary configurations or setting up the memory storage mechanisms.\n\n4. **Run Front-End Application**: If you're using a front-end framework, start the front-end application (e.g., using `npm start` for React or Angular) to allow users to interact with the Memory Companion.\n\n5. **Test the Integration**: After starting all the services, conduct tests to ensure that the Memory Companion is functioning as expected, retrieving and storing information properly.\n\nIf there are any specific commands or scripts you've been using that you'd like to confirm or discuss further, feel free to share!"

Managing opportunities in the **Daria Interview Tool** project typically involves a few key steps:\n\n1. **Identification**: Continuously monitor project progress and user feedback to identify potential opportunities for improvement or new features.\n\n2. **Documentation**: Clearly document each opportunity, including its description, priority level, potential impact, and any relevant details. This helps keep track of what needs attention.\n\n3. **Prioritization**: Assess the urgency and importance of each opportunity. You already have prioritized opportunities (like OPP-001 for a persistent database, OPP-002 for AWS deployment strategy, etc.), which can guide what to focus on next.\n\n4. **Implementation Planning**: For each opportunity, outline the steps needed to implement it. This might involve creating tasks, assigning team members, and setting deadlines.\n\n5. **Review and Update**: Regularly review the opportunities list to add new opportunities, update the status of existing ones, or remove those that are no longer relevant.\n\n6. **Team Collaboration**: If you're working with a team, ensure everyone is aware of the opportunities and encourage collaboration on identifying and addressing them.\n\nIf you\u2019re using specific tools or methods to manage opportunities, let me know, and I can provide more tailored advice!"
