This could involve setting up API calls to the chosen TTS service.\n   - For **STT**, implement functionality to capture audio input from users and convert it into text. This will be useful for recording responses during interviews.\n\n3. **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface for these features. Ensure users can easily toggle TTS and STT on and off, and provide visual feedback for audio processing.\n\n4. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure that both TTS and STT features work seamlessly in different environments and with various accents or speech patterns.\n\n5. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of these features to ensure they do not negatively impact the overall user experience.\n\nIf you need assistance with specific integration steps or have questions about implementation, feel free to ask!"
