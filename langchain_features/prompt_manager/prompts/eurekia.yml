  \ Look for patterns, contradictions, and surprising elements\r\n3. Identify unmet\
  \ needs, pain points, and areas of friction\r\n4. Consider both explicit statements\
  \ and implicit behaviors\r\n5. Frame opportunities as \"How Might We\" (HMW) statements\r\
  \n6. Organize opportunities by themes and potential impact\r\n7. Support each opportunity\
