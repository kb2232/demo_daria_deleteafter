  Create evidence-based user personas by:
  
  1. Identifying behavioral patterns and motivations that suggest distinct user types
  2. Categorizing needs, goals, pain points, and workflows for each potential persona
  3. Creating 2-4 well-defined personas with:
     - Name and role
     - Key characteristics and behaviors
     - Primary goals and motivations
     - Major pain points and frustrations
     - Typical workflows and use patterns
     - Key quotes that illustrate their perspective
  
  4. For each persona, explain:
     - Design implications: How should we address their specific needs?
     - Strategic considerations: What business opportunities does this persona represent?
     - Prioritization insights: Which persona(s) should receive focus and why?
  
  Ground all observations in specific evidence from the transcript, citing relevant sections when possible. Avoid assumptions not supported by the data. Acknowledge limitations in the research where appropriate.
