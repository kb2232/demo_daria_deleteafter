# Daria Interview Tool - Project Journal

## Project Overview
Daria Interview Tool is an AI-powered research interviewing platform currently in recovery phase after RC2 release. The system uses LangChain for orchestration, with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities for conducting automated interviews.

## Current Build Status
- **Release**: Post-RC2 Recovery Branch
- **Active Branch**: recovery-branch-fix
- **Core Features Working**: Interview flow, LangChain integration, TTS/STT, data storage
- **Key Recent Fix**: Debug Toolkit with end-to-end automation for interview flow
- **New Prototype**: Daria Memory Companion feature for project continuity

## Database Implementation Status
- **Current Storage**: JSON file-based storage
- **Planned**: Progressive migration to structured database (PostgreSQL or DynamoDB)
- **Database Schema**: Initial DynamoDB schema created but not fully implemented
- **Tables Designed**: 
  - Core: InterviewSessions, Transcripts
  - Analysis: Sprints, Opportunities, Personas
  - Output: AgileArtifacts, CursorPrompts
  - Management: Prototypes, JourneyMaps
  - New: ProjectJournal, TimelineEvents (for Memory Companion)

## Phased Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization** (Current)
   - Continue using file-based storage for RC2
   - Complete DynamoDB schema documentation
   - Prepare migration scripts
   - Create Memory Companion prototype

2. **Phase 2: Database Implementation** (2-5 weeks)
   - Implement core tables (Priority 1)
   - Create service abstraction layer
   - Build data migration tools
   - Implement project journal database tables

3. **Phase 3: Analysis Features** (5-8 weeks)
   - Implement analysis tables (Priority 2)
   - Build relationship management
   - Enhance semantic search
   - Integrate Memory Companion with main Daria interface

4. **Phase 4: Full Sprint Engine** (8-12 weeks)
   - Implement output tables (Priority 3)
   - Build sprint engine features
   - Add prototype generation
   - Complete Memory Companion with opportunity tracking

## AWS Deployment Status
- **Current**: Local development environment
- **Plan**: Deploy to AWS 
- **Approach**: 
  - Start with simple deployment to establish workflow
  - Add API integrations incrementally
  - Deploy full Daria platform once tested

## Recent Work History
- Analyzed codebase structure and current implementation
- Examined current file-based and planned database implementations
- Created comprehensive database migration plan
- Investigated current build (determined it's not RC3 but recovery-branch-fix)
- Created project journal system for continuity between sessions
- Developed Daria Memory Companion prototype

## Key Files to Review
- `RECOVERY_BRANCH_README.md`: Current recovery branch status and features
- `README_RC2.md`: RC2 release information
- `db/database.py`: Database connection management
- `setup_dynamodb.py`: Database schema setup script
- `db/transcripts.py`, `db/interview_sessions.py`: Database table implementations
- `DARIA_PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`: Project journal for continuity between sessions
- `static/daria_memory_companion.html`: Memory Companion prototype
- `DARIA_MEMORY_COMPANION.md`: Documentation for the Memory Companion feature

## Next Steps
1. Finalize database schema documentation (add Memory Companion tables)
2. Create SQLAlchemy models for core tables
3. Implement repository layer for key data types
4. Build testing framework for database migration
5. Begin progressive implementation of database features
6. Integrate Memory Companion with main Daria application

## Project Goals
1. Stable, reliable interview system
2. Structured database for better data management
3. AWS deployment for broader access
4. Full sprint engine capabilities with opportunity tracking
5. Integration of prototype generation via CursorAI
6. Persistent Memory Companion for project continuity

## Questions to Address
1. Priority of database implementation vs. AWS deployment
2. Preferred database technology (PostgreSQL vs. DynamoDB)
3. Timeline for next official release (RC3)
4. Scope of sprint engine features for initial release
5. Integration approach for Memory Companion feature

## Session Notes
### Session 3 (May 10, 2025)
- Here's a summary of what we've accomplished today:
- 
- ### Memory Companion Configuration & Integration
- - Fixed port conflicts between the main Daria application (port 5025) and Memory Companion (port 5030)
- - Updated all documentation, HTML files, and scripts to reference the correct ports
- - Modified the debug toolkit HTML to properly link to the memory companion on port 5030
- - Updated configuration files in multiple locations (debug_toolkit.html, memory_companion_info.html, DARIA_MEMORY_COMPANION.md)
- - Created proper start scripts that initialize services on their correct ports
- 
- ### Service Deployment & Verification
- - Successfully deployed and tested all services:
-   - Main Daria application (port 5025)
-   - Memory Companion (port 5030)
-   - Text-to-Speech service (port 5015)
-   - Speech-to-Text service (port 5016)
- - Confirmed integration with OpenAI API for LLM responses
- - Fixed issues in start_daria_with_memory.sh to ensure reliable startup
- 
- ### Implementation Testing
- - Tested Memory Companion API endpoints
- - Verified memory persistence between sessions
- - Confirmed the "50 First Dates" concept works as intended with Daria remembering project context
- - Tested the boot sequence and journal visualization components
- 
- ### Documentation Updates
- - Updated all relevant documentation to reflect the new port configuration
- - Made sure setup instructions accurately guide users to the correct URLs
- - Ensured a consistent approach to using the debug server vs. production server  
- 
- The system now successfully maintains project context across sessions and all components work together properly on their designated ports.

*Add notes from each working session here to maintain continuity*

### Session 1 (Current Date)
- Established project status and database implementation plan
- Created this project journal for continuity
- Determined current build is post-RC2 recovery branch, not RC3
- Outlined phased approach to database implementation

### Session 2 (Current Date)
- Created Memory Companion prototype based on "50 First Dates" concept
- Developed HTML/JS implementation in static/daria_memory_companion.html
- Added documentation in DARIA_MEMORY_COMPANION.md
- Updated project journal to include Memory Companion in the implementation plan
- Verified file structure and placement in the static directory
