# Indentation Error Fix in Transcript Processing

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing an `IndentationError` at line 2879 in the `run_interview_api.py` file. The error occurred in the `upload_transcript` function when processing transcript files. Specifically, the line `conversation_history = []` was improperly indented after a for statement on line 2877.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by improper indentation in the transcript processing section of the code. The `conversation_history` variable declaration was incorrectly indented after a for loop, which Python interpreted as being inside the loop when it should have been outside.

## Solution
1. Backed up the original file
2. Used sed to remove the problematic section (lines 2876-2911)
3. Added back the corrected code with proper indentation for the conversation history processing
4. Ensured proper structure of the for loop that maps transcript chunks to conversation history

## Implementation Details
The fix involved properly indenting the code for:
- Identifying speakers (researcher vs. participant)
- Mapping transcript chunks to conversation history
- Processing different transcript formats (Zoom-style with bracketed speaker names and timestamps)

## Verification
After the fix was applied:
1. The application successfully starts without indentation errors
2. Transcript uploads work correctly, converting the transcript text into proper conversation history
3. LangChain features can be enabled and the app provides enhanced interview capabilities

## Additional Improvements
This fix builds on previous improvements to the transcript upload feature, which included better handling of:
- Zoom-style transcripts 
- Bracketed speaker names
- Timestamp formatting
- Speaker identification

## Future Recommendations
1. Add more comprehensive error handling in data processing sections
2. Implement automated tests for transcript processing
3. Consider refactoring the transcript processing code into a separate module for better maintainability
